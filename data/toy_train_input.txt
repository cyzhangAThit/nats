-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was supposed to be a good week for the White House . <EOS> President Obama would celebrate the passage of Wall Street reform , and Democrats would move toward the midterms with some wind at their backs . <EOS> But on a day the president signed the landmark legislation , the narrative from the White House was more contrite than laudatory . <EOS> White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs apologized on behalf of the administration for what former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod had been through this week and that , to his knowledge , no one from the White House ordered her ouster . <EOS> Questions about Sherrod dominated the media briefings in a week the administration hoped would be focused on the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system since the New Deal . <EOS> Sherrod was forced to resign because of a misleading video of a speech she delivered at an NAACP event . <EOS> Conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart posted a portion of an address she gave in which she spoke of not offering her full support to a white farmer . <EOS> However , it was later determined that her speech , unedited , focused on how the incident changed her outlook and made her realize people should move beyond race . <EOS> The NAACP retracted its original condemnation of Sherrod 's remarks and issued a statement saying it was `` snookered by Fox News '' and Breitbart . <EOS> Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack apologized to Sherrod and offered her a new job . <EOS> `` This is a good woman . <EOS> She has been put through hell , '' Vilsack said . <EOS> `` I want to renew the commitment of this department to a new era in civil rights . <EOS> I want to close the chapter on a very difficult period in civil rights . '' <EOS> Sam Fulwood III , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , said he thinks the administration 's initial reaction was spawned out of fear over how the right-wing media would cover the incident . <EOS> He said administration officials `` allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it . '' <EOS> `` The White House , the administration , the Agriculture Department , whomever ... allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it , '' said Fulwood . <EOS> Instead of summoning Sherrod , reviewing the speech and asking what happened , the administration failed to knock down the lies and disseminate the truth , he said . <EOS> `` If they had done this in Ms. Sherrod 's case , they would be looking pretty . <EOS> They would have done great legislative work , and they would have scored a PR coup . <EOS> As it turns out , the legislative works gets obscured , '' and they are taking a PR-hit , Fulwood said . <EOS> Fulwood said that Obama 's problems stem from opinions being traded as though they are facts . <EOS> Throughout Obama 's time in office , the administration has done a weak job of quashing rumors , such as claims Obama was born in Indonesia , studied at a madrasa and has a forged birth certificate , he said . <EOS> `` I think if he is able to articulate an honest reaction to these nonsensical stories , they 'll be exposed for what they are -- nothing . <EOS> And that 's exactly what the case was with Shirley Sherrod , '' Fulwood added . <EOS> Obama spoke to Sherrod by phone Thursday and expressed his regret about what transpired this week . <EOS> He further said this misfortune `` can present an opportunity for her to continue her hard work on behalf of those in need , and he hopes that she will do so , '' according to a White House statement . <EOS> The call came exactly a year after Obama made a surprise appearance at a media briefing to discuss the controversial arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. . <EOS> The president , Gates and the arresting officer , Sgt. James Crowley , later met for a `` beer summit '' to discuss the event that sparked a nationwide debate about racial profiling . <EOS> The Congressional Black Caucus this week said it 's time for a national dialogue on race . <EOS> Gibbs called the incident `` one of those teachable moments '' and said that while he was unaware of plans for a broader discussion , he would n't rule it out . <EOS> John Quelch , professor of marketing at Harvard Business School , said that though the administration should have avoided this situation in the first place , the damage control has been rapid and effective . <EOS> As for a national discussion on race , Quelch said it 's not an issue the administration is interested in addressing in a high-profile manner right now . <EOS> But , he said , the White House now must balance `` the need to cope with emergency distractions versus the desire to stay on course with the longer-term agenda . '' <EOS> `` Obviously the objective is to remove this unscheduled story from media coverage in order to highlight the landmark financial reform legislation , '' he said . <EOS> By Friday afternoon , Obama was trying to get back on message before the weekend . <EOS> In an event added to the president 's schedule Friday morning , he tried to remind Americans what had been overshadowed during the week . <EOS> `` So , taken together , we made enormous progress this week on Wall Street reform , on making sure that we 're eliminating waste and abuse in government and in providing immediate assistance to people who are out there looking for work .

Twenty years ago , when Paul McCartney turned 50 , he remembers his then-manager pushing the idea of retirement . <EOS> `` It 's only right , '' he was told . <EOS> `` You really do n't want to go beyond 50 , it 's going to get embarrassing . '' <EOS> In June , McCartney will be 70 -LRB- `` I 'm never going to believe I 'm 70 , I do n't care what you say , '' he says . <EOS> `` There 's a little cell in my brain that 's never going to believe that '' -RRB- , and he still has no plans to stop touring or recording . <EOS> `` You get the argument ` Make way for the young kids , ' '' he says . <EOS> `` And you think , ` F *** that , let them make way for themselves . <EOS> If they 're better than me , they 'll beat me .

A busy Sunday saw four tournaments across three continents settled to underline the truly global nature of modern golf . <EOS> Spain 's Miguel Angel Jimenez became the oldest winner on the European Tour as the 48-year-old took top honors at the Hong Kong Open , while England 's Luke Donald won in Japan to reclaim the world No. 2 ranking from Tiger Woods . <EOS> In Australia , Adam Scott held off Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter to take his first title in 15 months at the Australian Masters and ease the pain of his British Open heartbreak back in July . <EOS> And if that was n't enough Sweden 's Henrik Stenson completed a hectic Sunday by recording victory in the SA Open Championship at the Serengeti Golf & Wildlife Estate in Pretoria , South Africa . <EOS> Do ` nice guys ' finish last ? <EOS> How to heal major heartbreak But back to Hong Kong , and the heroics of Jimenez who captured his 19th European Tour title and his 12th since turning 40 , by one shot over Sweden 's Fredrik Andersson Hed . <EOS> Jimenez , a European vice captain in the recent Ryder Cup , recorded a final round of 65 to earn his place in the record books by virtue of being six months older than Des Smyth when he won the Madeira Islands Open in 2001 . <EOS> `` It 's very nice -- I hope it 's not the last one , '' Jimenez joked in quotes on the European Tour 's official website . <EOS> `` The most important thing , I do what I like to do in my life , and golf has given me all of this pleasure . <EOS> Winning now , at 48 , my goodness -- 24 years I 've been on the Tour . <EOS> `` I still love it and I think that is fantastic , to love what you 're doing , and enjoy yourself , keep fit , keep working myself a little bit and stretching a lot , and that 's the main thing to do to compete with the new guns . <EOS> `` I really love this place . <EOS> I love the golf course -- it 's a great golf course where you have to control the ball very well , it 's not a matter of distance . '' <EOS> There were mixed fortunes for two other players who played their part in Europe 's remarkable Ryder Cup comeback in Medinah . <EOS> Luke Donald cruised to victory at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan by five shots to reclaim the world No. 2 ranking from 14-time major winner Tiger Woods . <EOS> Donald , who led from the front for most of the competition in Miyazaki , still has a long way to go to topple Rory McIlroy who is out in front of the rankings but he was delighted with his win . <EOS> He said on micro-blogging site Twitter : `` BOOM !! <EOS> 3rd win of the year - honored to add my name to the great Champions that have won the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament . <EOS> Golfer : I thought I was going to die `` Loved my week here in Japan - the Dunlop Phoenix is a great event , on a great course , great food , great beer ... it 's just great ! '' <EOS> But Ian Poulter was pipped to the Australian Masters crown by Adam Scott after the Englishman carded a disappointing final round . <EOS> With the pair well clear of the chasing pack Sunday came down to a straight shoot out between the pair and Scott went some way to erasing the painful memory of his British Open experience , when he led with four holes left and ended up losing . <EOS> Scott 's triumph means he has continued his run of winning at least one event in every season since 2001 . <EOS> After receiving his trophy and the golden jacket that goes with it he set his sights on a jacket of a different color -- the green one awarded to the winner of the Masters in Augusta . <EOS> `` It 's pretty awesome to be able to slip this jacket on . <EOS> Maybe I can set the theme of winning jackets and turn it green next year before I come back to defend , '' he was quoted as saying on the tournament 's website . <EOS> `` I have n't been dwelling on what happened at the Open at all , I put that out of my head in the week afterwards . <EOS> `` I had to , otherwise you 'd never come back to a golf course , would you ? <EOS> It 's kind of painful . <EOS> I 'd been working hard and I had n't quite got back in that position until today , but I felt good out there . <EOS> `` I just had to trust that all the work that I 'd put into my game was going to hold up and to not get in my own way is the big thing . <EOS> `` Not -LRB- to -RRB- have thoughts of what happened at the Open or any other negative thoughts come into play -- that 's just part of the mental side of this game . '' <EOS> The last of Sunday 's winner was 28-year-old Stenson , who held off the late challenge of George Coetzee to end a five-year run without a European Tour victory . <EOS> He also secured his place at next week 's World Tour Championship in Dubai after closing the tournament on 17-under , despite a blip half way through his round when he fell back to level pegging with his South African challenger . <EOS> `` It was great that I came down here , '' he told the European Tour website . <EOS> `` One of the bigger reasons was I was 59th in The Race to Dubai standings and I needed a good week . <EOS> `` I made it difficult for myself in the middle of the round there but hung in there and stayed patient . <EOS> I played well to shoot 17 under par around here in these windy conditions . <EOS> It was playing a lot harder today .

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Congress voted to halt planned cuts in Medicare payments to doctors Tuesday , overriding President Bush 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians . <EOS> President Bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices `` away from seniors to pay physicians . '' <EOS> The new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect July 1 . <EOS> The money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized Medicare Advantage program , which the Bush administration strongly supports . <EOS> Bush spiked the bill Tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be `` taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians . '' <EOS> `` I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , '' he said in his veto message . <EOS> The Senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over Bush 's objections , the third time in his presidency that Congress has overridden his veto . <EOS> The margin in the House of Representatives was a lopsided 383-41 , well beyond the two-thirds majority needed . <EOS> The American Medical Association lobbied heavily for the bill , warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing Medicare patients if the cuts went into effect . <EOS> But insurers , which receive government subsidies to offer Medicare Advantage plans , warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed . <EOS> A total of 21 Senate Republicans joined 47 Democrats and two independents in the override vote . <EOS> Supporters broke a GOP-led filibuster of the bill last week , aided by the dramatic return of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts . <EOS> Kennedy 's vote came in his first appearance on the Senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early June . <EOS> Though he did not vote Tuesday , Kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the `` misguided '' veto . <EOS> `` It 's a great vote , and a great day for America 's seniors , '' he said in a written statement . <EOS> Those Republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to Medicare in 2003 , when Congress created privately run , government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage . <EOS> `` These are not pro-patient policies , '' said Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Arizona . <EOS> `` Rather , the bill reduces access , benefits and choices for Medicare beneficiaries . '' <EOS> But critics of the 2003 reforms say Medicare Advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular Medicare , the federal health insurance program for seniors . <EOS> The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $ 12.5 billion by 2013 , largely by reducing Medicare Advantage enrollment . <EOS> Sen. Patty Murray , D-Washington , said the bill also made `` vital improvements '' by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care . <EOS> `` Today , we can stand up for Medicare , '' she said . <EOS> `` We did it last week , when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin , and I believe we can do it today by overriding that veto . '' <EOS> Congress had passed only two bills over Bush 's objections : a $ 23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $ 300 billion farm bill he spiked in May . <EOS> The Medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly Americans . <EOS> Rising health care costs have made Medicare a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age . <EOS> While the debate was raging over the bill , the AMA said the cuts could lead to a `` meltdown '' of the government 's health care system for the elderly . <EOS> A recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect . <EOS> `` We stand at the brink of a Medicare meltdown . <EOS> ... For doctors , this is not a partisan issue ; it 's a patient access issue , '' AMA President Nancy Nielsen said in a statement after last week 's Senate vote . <EOS> The AMA ran radio and TV ads over the July Fourth congressional recess targeting 10 Republican senators , seven of whom are up for re-election . <EOS> The AARP , the nation 's largest organization of retired people , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts . <EOS> Gerald Harmon , a family physician who practices in Pawleys Island , South Carolina , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer Medicare patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need . <EOS> `` This Medicare access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , '' said Harmon , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for Medicare . <EOS> `` It affects your dad when he 's sick . <EOS> It affects my patients in my practice . <EOS> This has to be addressed .

Dennis Rodman 's latest round of controversial `` basketball diplomacy '' in a country ruled by one of the world 's most repressive regimes is about to begin . <EOS> The former NBA star and a documentary crew are due to fly Thursday afternoon from China to North Korea , where he is to spend four days helping train a team of North Korean basketball players for a January exhibition in Pyongyang . <EOS> That January 8 exhibition -- said to be against a yet-unannounced team of former NBA players -- will celebrate the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , whom Rodman has called a friend and a `` very good guy '' despite international condemnation of the country 's human rights records . <EOS> Rodman 's trip -- sponsored by the online betting company Paddy Power -- is the 52-year-old 's third to North Korea . <EOS> North Korea : Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman Rodman said he struck a friendship with Kim , a basketball fan , during Rodman 's first trip in February . <EOS> After the two men sat next to each other watching a basketball exhibition in North Korea 's capital , Rodman told Kim that `` you have a friend for life . '' <EOS> Rory Scott , a Paddy Power spokesman , said earlier this month that December 's trip is nonpolitical , but is intended `` to prove once again that sport has the power to rise above all issues . '' <EOS> It 's not clear whether Rodman will meet with Kim during the basketball training visit . <EOS> The trip comes at a time of political turmoil in the secretive nuclear-armed nation , ongoing tensions between North Korea and the United States and outcries over North Korea 's human rights record . <EOS> Tensions in the region were ratcheted up as North Korea carried out a long-range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test , its third so far , in February . <EOS> The U.N. sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang . <EOS> Rodman was criticized over his first trip in part because it came during this period , in which North Korea was threatening missile strikes on the United States , South Korea and Japan . <EOS> The situation has calmed since . <EOS> But in a sign of internal political upheaval , North Korea announced last week that the regime had executed Kim 's uncle , Jang Song Thaek , who had been regarded as the country 's second-most powerful figure . <EOS> North Korea 's official news agency accused him of trying to overthrow the state . <EOS> Rodman is `` really important '' to the North Korean regime , said North Korea expert and Forbes.com columnist Gordon Chang . <EOS> `` Got to remember that Kim Jong Un needs to show that his regime , his government , is united , which it is n't , '' said Chang , author of `` Nuclear Showdown : North Korea Takes On the World . '' <EOS> `` With Dennis Rodman , we 're going to see a lot of made-for-television events . <EOS> Everybody 's going to be smiling , everything will appear normal , and this will bolster the regime , '' Chang told CNN Newsroom on Wednesday . <EOS> CNN Exclusive : The Pyongyang Big Bang ? <EOS> ` It is not my job to talk about ' detained American The United States has other points of contention with North Korea , including the detention of Korean-American Kenneth Bae . <EOS> Bae , arrested in North Korea in November 2012 , was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after he was found guilty of `` hostile acts '' and attempts to topple the government through religious activities . <EOS> U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korean officials to release Bae , widely reported to be a Christian missionary , on humanitarian grounds . <EOS> His family has said he suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors ' care . <EOS> Is Dennis Rodman smart on North Korea ? <EOS> Earlier this year , Rodman made no secret about his desire to help Bae . <EOS> He tweeted that he wanted Kim to `` do him a solid '' by freeing the American prisoner . <EOS> But after his second trip to see Kim in September , Rodman told reporters that it was `` not my job to talk about Kenneth Bae . '' <EOS> `` Ask Obama about that , ask Hillary Clinton about that , '' Rodman said . <EOS> `` Ask those -- holes . '' <EOS> Bae 's sister , Terri Chung , told CNN on Wednesday that she wants Rodman to press for her brother 's freedom . <EOS> `` I would certainly hope and plead with Mr. Rodman to reconsider and ... make the case '' for Bae 's freedom , she said . <EOS> Rodman , the tattooed and pierced NBA retiree , has emphasized that he 's not an official diplomat between the United States and North Korea . <EOS> `` It 's about trying to open Obama 's and everyone 's minds , '' he said in September while announcing the January exhibition , aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president . <EOS> `` You do n't have to talk about politics . <EOS> ... Meet him or even give him a call . <EOS> That 's all he wants . '' <EOS> Paddy Power has said Rodman 's team of former NBA players would be announced sometime this month.o North Korea frees U.S. veteran
When I was 8 , I joined the Boy Scouts . <EOS> I lasted three weeks -- could n't get the hang of all that knot tying , and no one was interested in singing show tunes around the campfire . <EOS> I was gay and I knew it . <EOS> At that time , revealing my sexual identity would have resulted in my exclusion from Scouting . <EOS> Until the Boy Scouts of America 's historic May 23 vote -- which allows gay youth to join the scouts , but upholds the ban on gay adult leaders -- thousands of boys across the country faced similar discrimination from the Scouts , who actively and vocally banned gays . <EOS> The Scouts ' decision to include gay youth is part of the sea change sweeping across the United States on the issue of gay equality , an issue that has long centered on equal rights for all . <EOS> But discrimination , in the Boy Scouts as in every walk of life , brings with it another effect that is left out of the conversation on rights : poorer health . <EOS> Hiding one 's sexual identity and being excluded from activities and social groups causes stress , and research shows this can have a significant impact on health . <EOS> In her review of the health of gay youth , Tumaini Coker notes that gay youth are three times more likely to partake in substance abuse , and that adolescents who said they felt stigmatized -- for example , in the form of family rejection -- are five times more likely to experience depression . <EOS> Still , this is an area that , unfortunately , has not been well studied . <EOS> On the rare occasions that this link is discussed , the academic community has tended to focus on adults . <EOS> But the health effects on young people who are stigmatized is surely as significant . <EOS> My own recent research , published in the American Journal of Men 's Health , drew on a sample of 1,000 gay men from Atlanta , and showed that gay men who reported that they heard statements such as `` being gay is not normal '' in their youth were more likely as adults to have unprotected sex and to have sex while intoxicated or high . <EOS> The study is among the first to demonstrate associations between stigma induced stress in childhood and negative health behaviors as adults that put them at risk for HIV infection . <EOS> There is already ample evidence to suggest that adult gay men and women experience poorer health relative to straight people . <EOS> Opinion : Boy Scouts ' decision makes no sense For one thing , gay men have been more heavily affected by the AIDS epidemic than the general population . <EOS> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , between 2006 and 2009 , gay men -- and other men who have sex with men -- were the only risk group to experience an increase in HIV incidence . <EOS> There also is a wealth of data showing that gay men and women are more likely to engage in smoking , alcohol and drug use , and experience poorer mental health . <EOS> A study of 577 gay adults by Sean McCabe and colleagues at the University of Michigan showed that gay adults who experience discrimination are nearly four times more likely to experience substance abuse disorders , while Diana Burgess and colleagues at the University of Minnesota noted that compared with heterosexuals , gay adults are 68 % more likely to experience depression and 56 % more likely to experience anxiety . <EOS> Ilan Meyer , a senior scholar at UCLA 's School of Law , offers an explanation for these disparities through the `` Theory of Minority Stress , '' which suggests that these health inequities may be rooted in discrimination , with negative health behaviors acting as coping mechanisms for repeated exposure to stigma-related stress . <EOS> Opinion : My take : Why my family is quitting the Boy Scouts As impressionable children we internalize messages we receive about what is right , what is normal , what we are allowed to be -- each shaping our views about our sexual identity and whether we `` belong . '' <EOS> Being exposed to messages that same-sex relationships are not `` normal '' is damaging . <EOS> These messages set scripts for youth to follow , divide them into normal and abnormal , and arm bullies with justification to harm them . <EOS> As my own research shows , these messages have lasting impacts sometimes fatal -- on health behaviors as adults . <EOS> The consequences for youth are painfully illustrated by the It Gets Better Project , created by writer Dan Savage in 2010 to give gay youth hope that life will be easier as a gay adult . <EOS> Savage developed the project in response to the high rates of suicide among gay youth . <EOS> Research indeed shows that gays are significantly more likely to attempt suicide compared with heterosexual youth -LRB- 21.5 % vs 4.2 % -RRB- , and that among gay youth , the risk of attempting suicide is 20 % greater in unsupportive environments compared with supportive environments . <EOS> Being told we are different at an age when we are trying to establish who we are can be devastating . <EOS> But what if it did n't have to get better ? <EOS> What if it could be better from the start ? <EOS> Last week the Boy Scouts sent an important signal to gay youth : You are not different . <EOS> But it is not quite enough . <EOS> The ban on gay Scout leaders remains . <EOS> Last week , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , withdrew his proposed amendment to provide U.S. citizens the right to sponsor their same-sex partners for green cards . <EOS> And in June the Supreme Court will vote on the Defense of Marriage Act . <EOS> Each inequity sends a message to young people that they can expect not to be treated equally when they grow up , setting them on the pathway to lowered self-esteem and poorer health . <EOS> Perhaps it is time to examine how we are treating America 's gay youth through that lens . <EOS> By creating equality , we can create better health right from the start .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 'm not an auto mechanic , I 'm an Army wife , a mother and -- when time permits -- a journalist . <EOS> So when my car needs work , I take it to someone with oil on his hands and years of experience looking under hoods . <EOS> The same is true for plumbing problems , legal issues and medical care . <EOS> I do n't assume that I know better than the experts . <EOS> When necessary , I get a second opinion but , ultimately , I always yield to the advice of those who know more than me . <EOS> With that in mind , I am thrilled that President Obama has decided to listen to his experts -- the military commanders and strategists -- and is committing more troops to Afghanistan . <EOS> But as an Army wife at Fort Bragg whose husband has already done three tours of duty in Afghanistan , I ca n't help but close my eyes , grit my teeth and brace myself for the hard days ahead . <EOS> As happy as I am that the president has finally made a move after months of deliberating , I know that this announcement is likely bad news for me . <EOS> Deployments are awful -- just awful . <EOS> There is no bright side and no silver lining . <EOS> For most of us in the military community the luster of sacrificing for our country wore off a deployment or two ago and we are now coasting on the fumes of commitment and shared sacrifice . <EOS> Many of us who are married to the military are n't even sure why we are willing to endure yet another deployment . <EOS> We just are . <EOS> Our spouses see the fight firsthand and are reminded daily of why this battle must be won . <EOS> They get pep talks at work and enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers . <EOS> We at home just hear the gripes of war-weary Americans and see the news reports of waning support . <EOS> We do n't experience the victories , we only see our children developing emotional problems , our marriages falling apart , our careers sidelined , our dependence on antidepressants climbing , even our houses crumbling from years of neglected repairs . <EOS> That 's why a troop surge in Afghanistan brings mixed feelings . <EOS> More troops there means more casualties -- a word I do n't take lightly . <EOS> Casualties are people , people with names and faces that I know . <EOS> I see their wheelchairs at my kids ' schools and I 've dropped flowers on their freshly dug graves . <EOS> A troop surge may mean that even more of my friends will be widows and more of their children will be fatherless . <EOS> It certainly means more Little League teams in my community will be missing a coach , more families here will know each other only on Skype and more pets will be abandoned . <EOS> It may very well mean that I will spend more years being both mother and father , and that I 'll have more conversations with my children about why their daddy is always gone when so many daddies never leave . <EOS> These are not things to celebrate . <EOS> But right now , after just hearing our president give an inspiring speech , I 'm going to consider that this plan may mean that my friends who are in Afghanistan now will finally have what they need to stay safe . <EOS> Maybe it will mean that if and when my husband has to go back there , he will be in a better and safer situation . <EOS> And , more than anything else , maybe it will mean that our nation will succeed in Afghanistan and that all of these years that my husband and I have lost together , all of these friends we 've buried , all of these injuries he and others have nursed -- will have been worth it . <EOS> I am not a strategist . <EOS> I do not know what will take us to victory in Afghanistan . <EOS> I can not say if sending 30,000 more troops is the right or the wrong decision . <EOS> All I know is that the president consulted the experts and then he sought second , third , fourth -- and who knows how many more -- opinions , and this is the solution he has reached . <EOS> I commend him for making a definitive plan . <EOS> I will pray for his wisdom and for the strength and safety of the troops who will be going into harm 's way , just as I pray for those who are already there . <EOS> I will also pray for all the families back home who are about to send their soldier or Marine into the fight . <EOS> Theirs is a battle I know . <EOS> For many of them , their war is just starting . <EOS> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebekah Sanderlin .
A grueling qualification campaign is over , and for 32 footballing nations the dreaming can begin . <EOS> On Friday those lucky enough to have qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil will learn who they are to meet in the group stage at one of the biggest sporting showpieces on the planet . <EOS> The fixtures will be finalized -- this year by a more complicated process than previous events -- the participants will discover where their matches are to be played and they can start plotting a route to the final in Rio de Janeiro . <EOS> For the host nation , too , this is a chance to generate some positive news after months of headlines detailing delays in construction and public protests at spiraling costs . <EOS> The most recent , and tragic , tale to emerge concerned the death of two construction workers after a crane collapsed at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo -- due to host the World Cup 's opening match . <EOS> Friday marks the start of a countdown to June 12 next year , when Brazil will begin a month-long festival of football , likely to captivate the world . <EOS> Where ? <EOS> The draw will take place in the resort of Costa do Sauipe in Bahia on the northeast coast of Brazil . <EOS> In attendance will be representatives from each World Cup nation as well as FIFA 's top brass , including president Sepp Blatter . <EOS> The ceremony will be broadcast live to 193 countries from 1 p.m. local time -LRB- 1700 CET -RRB- with 1,300 guests alongside a bank of 2,000 reporters . <EOS> As ever , there will be entertainment , including turns from Brazilian singers Alexandre Pires and Vanessa da Mata as well as dance troupe Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker . <EOS> There has been some controversy already when the two actors scheduled to host the draw -- Lazaro Ramos and Camila Pitanga , who both have dark skin -- were replaced by another married celebrity couple , Fernanda Lima and Rodrigo Hilbert , who are blond and white . <EOS> What is it ? <EOS> The World Cup draw determines which of the 32 nations will face each other in the group stages . <EOS> Teams will be drawn into eight groups of four , based on FIFA 's seeding system and geographical separation , meaning that teams from the same qualification zone ca n't be drawn in the same group . <EOS> There is an exception for European countries , given there are 13 participating in the tournament , but no more than two from the region can be drawn in the same group . <EOS> The winners of a particular group will face the runner-up of another when the tournament enters its final-16 stage -- the first of the knockout rounds . <EOS> The seedings Eight teams in the draw are seeded -- seven are the highest placed teams from FIFA 's rankings , the other is host Brazil . <EOS> The top seven when the seedings were announced in October comprised of defending champion Spain along with Germany , Argentina , Colombia , Belgium , Uruguay and Switzerland . <EOS> The seedings are calculated on how a team has played over the past four years , with the most recent year given greatest importance . <EOS> Teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat . <EOS> The points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match . <EOS> Uneven numbers When there are eight unseeded European teams -- as in 2010 -- the draw works easily and smoothly , meaning FIFA can organize the nations into four pots of eight teams . <EOS> But because there are nine unseeded European teams in the 2014 World Cup , things become a little more complicated . <EOS> FIFA has decided to put these nine teams into one pot , and prior to the draw they will pull out one nation to go into pot two with five African nations and the two unseeded South American sides . <EOS> That country will be selected at random , despite France -- which qualified through the playoffs -- being the lowest ranked nation from the European qualifying phase . <EOS> This random element has not gone down well with some of the other countries in that part of the draw . <EOS> Pot X As a starting point , Brazil will automatically be drawn into Group A due to its role as host . <EOS> Then the other seeded teams will be allocated their groups , which runs as far as Group H. And then it gets rather complicated . <EOS> With one of the unseeded European teams now residing in pot two , there are now nations from three geographical zones in the same pot . <EOS> That increases the chances of three European teams ending up in the same group , a violation of FIFA 's `` geographical separation '' principle . <EOS> As such , the governing body decided to create `` Pot X '' into which four of the seeded South American teams will be placed . <EOS> One is drawn out and then paired together in a group with the unseeded European team from pot two . <EOS> After that , the rest of the teams will be allocated to their groups -- with the only other issue residing with Chile and Ecuador , who can skip a group in order to avoid being drawn with seeded South American teams . <EOS> Group of Death As ever with any high-profile soccer draw there is the potential for the much-touted `` Group of Death . '' <EOS> Whichever unseeded European team is plucked out of pot four and put into pot two might be forgiven for watching the rest of the draw from behind their sofa . <EOS> That nation will be guaranteed to face one of the South American seeds from Pot X -- Brazil , Argentina , Colombia or Uruguay . <EOS> Then they could face the United States from pot three and either Italy or Netherlands from pot four , making qualification for the last 16 much harder .
Pain from forced spending cuts is a week away and lawmakers are preparing their aides for the fallout that could hit them like other government workers . <EOS> `` We 've actually budgeted with a 10 % cut in mind , '' Rep. Cheri Bustos , D-Illinois , said last week . <EOS> Rep. Dennis Ross , R-Florida , reorganized his office in December . <EOS> `` We had to let people go then because we were anticipating at least a 16 % cut , '' he said . <EOS> Pentagon : Furloughs for civilian workers if forced cuts go into effect But members of Congress , the very people who voted to put the automatic spending cuts in place , wo n't see any change to their annual salary of $ 174,000 . <EOS> Why ? <EOS> Because Congress can change its pay only by passing a law to do so . <EOS> Before Congress left town for a week 's recess , CNN took an informal survey and asked lawmakers whether they were willing to take a pay cut if the so-called sequester was set in motion on March 1 . <EOS> Most lawmakers in both parties said yes . <EOS> `` Well , certainly . <EOS> I mean , we 're all in this together . <EOS> We 're all suffering together , '' said Mark Meadows , R-North Carolina . <EOS> `` Absolutely . <EOS> Let 's make sure that we 're doing our part as well , '' said Rep. Ben Lujan , D-New Mexico . <EOS> `` Oh , sure . <EOS> Yeah , I mean , that 's called leadership , '' responded Rep. Steve Southerland , R-Florida . <EOS> But cutting lawmaker pay is n't so easy . <EOS> The 27th Amendment prohibits members of Congress from changing their compensation until after the next election . <EOS> Still , they can get creative by writing checks to charity or the U.S. Treasury . <EOS> Ironically , some tea party-backed lawmakers who campaigned on slashing federal spending are reluctant to give up their pay . <EOS> Poll : Deficit is essential issue for Congress to tackle Rep. Billy Long , R-Missouri , was elected in 2010 to cut Washington spending . <EOS> `` Do you think members of Congress should take a pay cut ? '' <EOS> CNN asked . <EOS> `` I do n't think so , '' he responded . <EOS> `` I mean , I do n't think we should raise our pay . '' <EOS> But what about the fact that congressional aides may be furloughed ? <EOS> `` It 's such a miniscule part , '' Long said . <EOS> Former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann answered the question about whether she personally would take a pay cut -- asked several times -- by talking only about her staff . <EOS> `` We 'd like to keep everybody on the payroll if we can , but they 'll have to work fewer hours . <EOS> So , we 're looking at reductions in our staff , and that 's what we need to do , '' said the Minnesota Republican . <EOS> CNNMoney : Biggest problems with forced budget cuts Two members of Congress returned part of their office budgets to the Treasury this week . <EOS> Standing in front of an oversized check for $ 600,000 -- or 20 % of his budget -- Sen. Rand Paul , R-Kentucky , said his office treated funds `` like it 's our money , or your money , and we look at every expenditure . '' <EOS> Rand Paul returns more money to Treasury Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R-South Carolina , said he would return $ 160,000 to the federal government , or 12 % of his office budget . <EOS> One of the biggest opponents of Congress cutting its pay is one of the wealthiest , Nancy Pelosi . <EOS> The House Democratic leader says she knows other members of Congress are not as financially fortunate . <EOS> `` Most of my colleagues are the breadwinners in their families , said Pelosi . <EOS> `` A pay cut , to me , does n't mean as much . '' <EOS> CNNMoney : Federal worker furloughs could start in April
World No. 1 Novak Djokovic was dumped out of the Madrid Open in the second round after an inspired performance by 21-year-old Grigor Dimitrov . <EOS> The Bulgarian had n't previously won a set against the six-time grand slam winner but took the match in three sets to secure the biggest scalp of his career to date . <EOS> Djokovic , from Serbia , received treatment on his ankle during the second set but recovered to save a match point and send the match into a decider . <EOS> But Dimitrov held his nerve to break Djokovic 's serve twice in the final set and take the match 7-6 6-7 6-3 . <EOS> Roger Federer showed little signs of rustiness as he dispatched Radek Stepanek to move into the third round . <EOS> The 17-time grand slam winner and defending champion cruised past his Czech opponent , wrapping up a 6-3 6-3 victory in 81 minutes . <EOS> The Swiss was last in action in mid-March when he was knocked out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells by Spain 's Rafael Nadal . <EOS> But despite his near two-month absence from competition , the 31-year-old was back in the groove swiftly to set up a meeating with either Japan 's Kei Nishikori or Viktor Troicki of Serbia . <EOS> `` I did n't think I played incredible , but that 's not what I was expecting myself to do here . <EOS> But I did n't play bad , either , '' Federer told the official ATP Tour website . <EOS> `` So I 'm very happy with how things went today . <EOS> Stepanek is a player who can cause a lot of difficulties in the game . <EOS> He has caused me difficulties in the past . <EOS> Today that was n't the case . <EOS> I thought I was pretty much in control . '' <EOS> Federer , world No. 2 , defeated Tomas Berdych in the 2012 Madrid final and is looking for a 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title , which would see him draw level with Nadal 's tally . <EOS> Unlike Federer , the world No. 3 , Britain 's Andy Murray , was made to work hard for his place in round three after overcoming Germany 's Florian Mayer 7-6 7-6 . <EOS> Murray saved five set points in the opener and came from a break down in the second set to register his 400th Tour victory in just over two hours . <EOS> He will face French No. 16 seed Gilles Simon next . <EOS> The 25-year-old told a press conference : `` I felt like I hit the ball very well today . <EOS> I just did n't return so well . <EOS> That was the only thing I would have liked to have done better . '' <EOS> `` He served well and hit a lot of aces on those points , but also I was n't reading the serve . <EOS> So even when I was getting to it I was a little bit late and missed a few too many returns . <EOS> `` Apart from that , I moved very well , which I did n't do in Monte Carlo , so that 's a big improvement . '' <EOS> Two top 10 seeds were knocked out on an eventful Tuesday . <EOS> Czech Janko Tipsarevic , seeded nine , was beaten 7-6 6-3 by Argentinean Juan Monaco while Richard Gasquet , the French No. 8 seed was defeated 7-5 3-6 6-4 by Daniel Gimeno-Traver , from Spain . <EOS> There were also wins for Stanislas Wawrinka , the Swiss No. 16 seed , and Tommy Haas , the No. 13 seed from Germany . <EOS> In the women 's draw , Serena Williams beat Spain 's Lourdes Dominguez Lino 6-2 7-5 . <EOS> The world No. 1 was then asked about comments about her from American starlet Sloane Stephens . <EOS> In an interview with ESPN magazine Stephens , who stunned Williams by beating her in the Australian Open quarterfinals , claimed Serena had n't spoken to her since that match in January . <EOS> But Williams refused to criticize the 20-year-old and told reporters : `` I 'm a big Sloane Stephens fan and always have been . <EOS> I 've always said that I think she can be the best in the world . <EOS> I 'll always continue to think that and always be rooting for her . <EOS> `` I really just always wish her and anyone , really , especially from America the best . <EOS> We do n't have that many American players , so it 's always exciting to see so many young players doing so well . '' <EOS> Elsewhere , Mario Bartoli , the French No. 15 seed , recovered from an injury to her ankle as she beat Spaniard Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-4 2-6 6-4 . <EOS> Germany 's Sabine Lisicki and Russia 's Svetlana Kuznetsova were also winners , beating Dominika Cibulkova and Nadia Petrova respectively .

LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down . <EOS> An airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington 's Dulles airport last year . <EOS> According to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon , the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday -LRB- 10:15 p.m. ET Sunday -RRB- , three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , for Paris , France . <EOS> At that point , the plane 's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company 's maintenance computers , indicating `` several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down . '' <EOS> The jet , which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph , also sent a warning that it had lost pressure , the Brazilian air force said . <EOS> Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m. , the Brazilian air force spokesman added . <EOS> The assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft 's controls . <EOS> What brought Flight AF 447 down ? <EOS> Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility , particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone -LRB- ITCZ -RRB- . <EOS> This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge . <EOS> The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ , raising its humidity and making it buoyant . <EOS> Aided by the convergence of the trade winds , the buoyant air rises , releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms . <EOS> The airliner 's route According to CNN 's Mari Ramos , these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over . <EOS> Watch more about the weather systems Retired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms . <EOS> `` Because safety is the paramount concern , airliners do n't fly into storms . <EOS> They fly around them , '' he said . <EOS> `` The ITCZ is no different . <EOS> Planes fly through it every day . <EOS> `` At 8 miles per minute , modern jets can easily fly around storms . <EOS> Even if they encounter turbulence , they 're designed to absorb it . '' <EOS> When lightning strikes a plane , the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it , such as a wing tip . <EOS> Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point , such as the tail . <EOS> But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded . <EOS> Unlike other aircraft where the pilot 's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders , Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a `` fly by wire '' system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces . <EOS> Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning . <EOS> `` If you have a massive electrical problem it 's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces , '' said aeronautics expert John Hansman . <EOS> However , Kieran Daly , from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence , told CNN that this scenario , while not impossible , is inconceivable . <EOS> `` It 's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure , '' he said . <EOS> `` It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure . '' <EOS> He added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system . <EOS> The `` trim tab , '' which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder , would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely . <EOS> `` Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator , '' he said . <EOS> Former Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year . <EOS> `` They do n't go down , '' he said . <EOS> According to Air France , the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft . <EOS> Of the two first officers , one had flown 3,000 flight hours -LRB- 800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340 -RRB- and the other 6,600 -LRB- 2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340 -RRB- . <EOS> The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005 . <EOS> Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009 .

'' <EOS> But the bulletin notes last year 's Oregon plot to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree lighting . <EOS> That one allegedly involved a homegrown suspect . <EOS> And the bulletin says that as of February 2010 , al Qaeda was considering attacks on the United States on symbolic dates such as Christmas , but there 's no information to indicate that led to actual al Qaeda plots . <EOS> These sorts of bulletins have come out at holiday time in past years . <EOS> But this is the first once since the death of Osama bin Laden . <EOS> Meanwhile , rain has prompted flood watches in parts of Pennsylvania ; up to 8 inches of snow have fallen in central parts of Maine ; showers are soaking northern Florida ; and wind gusts of up to 98 mph have been reported along the Oregon coast , CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said . <EOS> `` It 's going to be a rough go for a whole lot of people , '' she said . <EOS> Flight delays were spreading Wednesday afternoon , with Newark International , LaGuardia , San Francisco International and Boston 's Logan International airports reporting problems . <EOS> Check Federal Aviation Administration flight delay information That 's bad news for those who are on the move for the annual November trek to see family and friends , feast on turkey and pumpkin pie , and rediscover the joys of their hometowns on Thanksgiving . <EOS> AAA projects that 42.5 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles during the Thanksgiving weekend , an increase of 4 % from last year . <EOS> Slightly fewer people are choosing to get to their destinations by plane . <EOS> About 23.2 million travelers will fly over a 12-day period surrounding Turkey Day , a 2 % drop from last year , according to a forecast by the Air Transport Association of America . <EOS> Unlike last year , when the National Opt-Out Day movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country , air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest-induced delays . <EOS> -LRB- The Opt-Out Day turned out to be a nonevent . -RRB- <EOS> The Transportation Security Administration says it has prepared its work force for a `` smooth holiday travel experience for travelers .

Mitt Romney worshiped his father . <EOS> Barack Obama barely knew his . <EOS> In the nature-versus-nurture debate , psychologists say fathers play an important role in the men their sons become . <EOS> And the two presidential candidates ' relationships with their fathers offer insight into the men they are today . <EOS> `` It 's called the cloth of individuality , '' said Dr. Ditta M. Oliker , a clinical psychologist whose research has focused on the lasting effects of childhood in adulthood . <EOS> Rather than an either/or , she said , psychologists now recognize the cloth that results from the interweaving of a person 's DNA and experience dictates both personality and character . <EOS> In President Obama 's and Romney 's cases , fathers -- present or absent -- are a large part of that cloth . <EOS> And in both cases , psychologists say their fathers ' presented different obstacles and opportunities . <EOS> Obama was raised largely by his maternal grandparents and spent much of his childhood and adulthood decoding stories he heard about Barack Obama Sr. 's life . <EOS> He writes in his book `` Dreams of My Father '' about piecing together newspaper clippings , photographs and his family 's stories in building a portrait of his father . <EOS> `` My father became a prop in someone else 's narrative , '' Obama wrote , `` An attractive prop -- the alien figure with the heart of gold , the mysterious stranger who saves the town and wins the girl -- but a prop nonetheless . '' <EOS> But depending on a child 's support system , Oliker does n't think an absent father is necessarily an obstacle . <EOS> It leaves room for `` imagination , wishful thinking and dreams , '' she says . <EOS> `` Depending on how the family talked about it will make a difference in how the person emerges from the myth of the father . '' <EOS> Romney , on the other hand , followed closely in his father 's footsteps . <EOS> Both were successful businessmen , then governors and finally presidential candidates -LRB- although George Romney ended his run before the first Republican primary in 1968 -RRB- . <EOS> `` My dad is Mitt 's hero , '' G. Scott Romney , Mitt 's older brother , told New York Magazine . <EOS> `` And , look , I think my brother 's an exceptional person . <EOS> But Mitt has said he 's a shadow of his father . '' <EOS> Romneys share looks but not traits , colleagues say It could have been difficult for Romney to come out of his father 's shadow . <EOS> `` I would raise the question whether Romney does n't struggle a bit with meeting the high expectations that were put on him because ... you are your father 's son , '' Oliker said . <EOS> She says studies of sons of successful men show that their children often falter because they can not live up to the aura . <EOS> Both doctors say how the candidates ' developed out of their relationships with their fathers can say a lot about the way they approach their candidacies , and in Obama 's case , his time in office . <EOS> `` You see a path in -LSB- Romney 's -RSB- maturing over the years , in what some people might call ` flip-flopping ' could be explained as a maturing path into finding his own stance , '' Dr. Henry Cloud , a clinical psychologist and author of `` The One Life Solution : Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success , '' explained of Romney . <EOS> `` Sometimes it takes a boy with that kind of power figure over him time to declare -LSB- who he is -RSB- . '' <EOS> Cloud added that Romney lately seems to be more comfortable in his skin , perhaps a sign that he is assuming the alpha position once occupied by his father . <EOS> Obama 's father 's absence , on the other hand , could be credited in part for his sky 's - the-limit style that helped him win the 2008 election . <EOS> `` He did n't grow up with the father over him , which is where the boy gets the sense of limits , '' Cloud said referring to the president as a visionary . <EOS> `` He does n't govern -LSB- the executive branch -RSB- in thinking what they ca n't do , but rather what they can do . '' <EOS> Romney , Obama : Why they have trouble connecting But for both candidates , Oliker says , much of the credit for who the men are today rests on their own shoulders . <EOS> `` Both men had to have strong character and had to have strong drive to reach what they have reached , in both cases perhaps in spite of their fathers , '' she said . <EOS> For Romney , Cloud says it would be possible for a strong father figure to push his child down a lesser path . <EOS> Instead , he says warmth present in the Romney home could have curbed negative impacts of his powerful father . <EOS> For Obama , too , it was also the sum of the people around him that may have made up for his absent father . <EOS> `` It takes a village , '' Oliker said . <EOS> Regardless of their circumstances , both doctors agree that the mixture of the two men 's personalities and the circumstances that helped them develop into adulthood were the right fit . <EOS> `` There were obviously things that went well with both of them . <EOS> Both the hero father and the absent father , the message in this is that somebody did something right , '' Cloud said .
Punk rock fuel-injected the beat of rock and roll in the mid-1970s with a frenetic tempo . <EOS> On Friday , the drummer who gunned out those rhythms with pioneering punk band the Ramones passed away . <EOS> Tommy Ramone was 65 and the last living original member of the band , which debuted its first album in 1976 . <EOS> Ramone was also one of the band 's composers . <EOS> A notice of his death was posted on the band 's Facebook page with his age . <EOS> The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame reported that he was 62 . <EOS> Ramone was reportedly battling cancer when he died . <EOS> With their racing-pulse beat and disparaging , cynical lyrics that were combined with oddly florid but loud guitar riffs , the Ramones kicked off a music and counterculture movement in New York that quickly spread to Britain . <EOS> It came echoing back from London in variations from groups like the Clash and the Sex Pistols . <EOS> Glue-sniffing darkness Their debut album , `` Ramones , '' left little doubt about the direction of the new rock style with song titles like : `` Beat on the Brat , '' `` Chain Saw , '' `` Now I Wan na Sniff Some Glue . '' <EOS> Not all of their lyrics were dark . <EOS> Some were playful ruckus , but most of them seemed to come `` from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind , '' as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame put it . <EOS> Their head-banging rock cut like a machete into the candy-glazed , infatuated glam pop of the time that was vaulting the band ABBA to Beatles-like elevations . <EOS> A flock of similar kissable , bell-bottomed groups were riding their coattails . <EOS> Then punk rock slammed into the party head-on . <EOS> Clashing with glam pop The Ramones ' black leather , torn jeans and canvas sneakers clashed with the rainbow satin , sequins and platform shoes that had overtaken youth culture . <EOS> The everyday heroes the Ramones sang about had dumped surfboards and disco gyrations for lives as pogo-ing punk rockers in the urban grit of places like Berlin and New York . <EOS> The Ramones were practically the house band of the hole-in-the-wall rock bar CBGB on lower Manhattan 's Bowery , a neighbor to skid row . <EOS> Other American punk and new wave acts like Blondie , the Cramps and Joan Jett joined them there . <EOS> The Hall of Fame credits the band with saving rock music `` from one of its lowest ebbs . '' <EOS> `` The Ramones got back to basics : simple , speedy , stripped-down rock and roll songs . <EOS> Voice , guitar , bass , drums . <EOS> No makeup , no egos , no light shows , no nonsense . '' <EOS> Tommy Ramone said the intention was innovation with a statement . <EOS> `` It was n't just music in the Ramones : it was an idea . <EOS> It was bringing back a whole feel that was missing in rock music -- it was a whole push outwards to say something new and different , '' he said . <EOS> Iron Curtain While his Hall of Fame biography states that Ramone was born Tom Erdelyi in Budapest , Hungary , he was actually born in that city as Erdelyi Tamas , on January 29 , 1949 , and his name was changed to Tom Erdelyi after he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1957 , according to Andy Schwartz , a representative of Ramone 's longtime domestic partner , Claudia Tienan . <EOS> It was during the morbid wake of World War II , when the Soviet Union was beginning to cement Eastern Europe into a communist bloc . <EOS> Some of the Ramones ' music reflects that Cold War background with songs like `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' and the album `` Rocket to Russia . '' <EOS> Ramone built his music career on the band but handed over the drum sticks in 1978 . <EOS> In subsequent years , he still drummed , composed and produced for other bands , including the Talking Heads . <EOS> But in the decade prior to his death , he did n't play drums for any band , including Uncle Monk , the acoustic duo he formed with Tienan , Schwartz said . <EOS> Ramone also stopped composing for other artists during this period , Schwartz said . <EOS> The other original band members passed away between 2001 and 2004 , according to the Hall of Fame . <EOS> Joey Ramone , born Jeffrey Hyman , died of cancer in 2001 at age 49 . <EOS> Dee Dee Ramone , born Douglas Colvin , died from an apparent overdose in 2002 at age 49 . <EOS> Johnny Ramone , born John Cummings , died of cancer in 2004 at age 52 . <EOS> People we lost in 2014
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dozens of lawmakers support legislation that would set up a more streamlined system for matching Haitian orphans with families in the United States , a U.S. senator said Tuesday . <EOS> Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana , said that the initial focus of the legislation would be on children orphaned by the January 12 earthquake in Haiti but that in the long term , it also would address other adoption efforts . <EOS> She and other senators will press this week to get the Families for Orphans Act out of a Senate committee so it can go to the floor for a vote , she said at a news conference . <EOS> The bill would set up a separate office in the State Department to handle adoption issues , similar to the office that handles human trafficking , Landrieu said . <EOS> The office would focus on the issues of orphans and adoptions . <EOS> `` The old regular process , the old regular bureaucracy , is not going to work , '' she said . <EOS> Find loved ones in Haiti | Share your story Gordon Duguid , deputy spokesman for the State Department , said there are about 1,200 pending adoption cases . <EOS> The department says that 497 orphans have come to the United States since the January 12 earthquake and have been united with their adoptive parents . <EOS> That number includes 100 orphans who arrived Tuesday , Duguid said . <EOS> `` We will continue to work until we get through all pending cases , '' he said . <EOS> `` But we will send no child out of Haiti who does not have cleared , vetted and accepted parents waiting for him or her in the U.S. '' An exception will be made if a child needs urgent medical attention or has some other dire problem , he said . <EOS> `` We are determined to thwart traffickers and are not processing new applications for adoptions , '' he added . <EOS> Last week , the State Department said it was working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who were waiting to adopt Haitian children . <EOS> Of those , 200 cases were being accelerated , the agency said . <EOS> The department said that some of those orphans are eligible to come to the United States under a humanitarian waiver , unless they can be issued permanent papers . <EOS> Before the quake , 380,000 children in Haiti were classified as orphans , Landrieu said , quoting figures from the United Nations , which defines an orphan as someone who has lost one parent . <EOS> The first priority , she said , is to reunite a child with its family , or to find other relatives or a family in Haiti willing to adopt the child . <EOS> On Tuesday , the State Department said 497 Haitian orphans had been evacuated to the United States since the quake . <EOS> Sen. Kit Bond , R-Missouri said the red tape in Washington should n't slow down the adoption process for Haitian children . <EOS> Sen. Amy Klobuchar , D-Minnesota , agreed . <EOS> `` We have to have a better process here . <EOS> These are extraordinary circumstances , '' she said . <EOS> Last week , 14 orphans heading to Pennsylvania were n't allowed to leave Haiti because they had no papers , said Rep. Jason Altmire , D-Pennsylvania , who had gone to Haiti to accompany the group to the United States . <EOS> The paperwork was lost in the quake , he added . <EOS> Finally , with intervention from several agencies and the White House , the U.S. Embassy approved humanitarian waivers , or paroles , for the children . <EOS> Several senators at the briefing mentioned the need to keep children safe from human trafficking while they are awaiting travel or in transit . <EOS> Their concerns echoed those expressed by charities , aid groups and Haitian officials in recent days . <EOS> `` We know there have been reports that children left the country without going through the authorization of the prime minister or other authorities , '' Julie Bergeron , chief of child protection for the United Nations Children 's Fund , said Sunday . <EOS> `` We have such reports . <EOS> We are trying to discuss with different authorities to find a solution to prevent trafficking of children . <EOS> ... `` But it 's very difficult to have the overall picture at the moment . <EOS> It 's overwhelming particularly because there is no registration system . <EOS> So now that is what we are trying to do : have registration of children so that we have a better idea , '' Bergeron said . <EOS> According to Haiti 's minister of communication , Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lessgue , `` The Haitian government is very clear on this . <EOS> We are facilitating all of the adoption applications already submitted . <EOS> Other than those , no child will be leaving the country for adoption , only those whose applications are already on file . '' <EOS> Cinzia Angotti , a child protection officer for the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission to Haiti , said workers are trying to identify the children at risk , `` the ones who are along without family , and to respond as quickly as possible to the lack of protection of children during this disaster . '' <EOS> Groups including Save the Children and World Vision have called for a halt to adoptions , saying that many children who may appear to be orphaned have simply been separated from their families .
More and more airlines are teaming up with world-class chefs , hoping to solve that ultimate #firstworldproblem : how to serve a top-rate meal in the air . <EOS> The strategy seems to be to throw glamorous , big-name chefs at the problem and hope that they can recreate on planes that same gastronomic magic they do at their restaurants . <EOS> Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal helped British Airways with a special Olympic in-flight menu in 2012 ; Joel Robuchon and Air France have made headlines with their collaboration , which began in 2011 . <EOS> The Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong has also been tasked with creating a first-class menu for Cathay Pacific . <EOS> Their Italian restaurant , Tosca , is famous for creative Italian cooking and recently received one Michelin star after Pino Lavarra took over as executive chef . <EOS> Lavarra was asked to whip up a gourmet menu that will work at 30,000 feet above sea level . <EOS> He went one step further : Lavarra is serving the same in-flight meal at Tosca as a special four-course `` first class menu '' costing HK$ 1,400 -LRB- $ 180 -RRB- per head . <EOS> Airplane food served at an expensive restaurant ? <EOS> Lavarra admits it 's not the easiest sell . <EOS> `` I agree that in-flight food has a bad reputation . <EOS> I also find most of it terrible , '' says the chef . <EOS> Lofty ambitions He says The Ritz-Carlton 's height inspired the menu . <EOS> The hotel is nearly 500 meters -LRB- 1,640 feet -RRB- above ground , earning it the superlative of `` world 's highest hotel , '' and bringing its guests close to a mid-air experience , without them getting on a plane . <EOS> The two menus -- in-flight and on the ground -- ca n't be exactly the same however . <EOS> Lavarra says the idea of recreating gourmet restaurant experiences in the air will only ever be a concept . <EOS> In reality , it will never be replicated . <EOS> `` The meal served on the plane , it 's cooked by somebody else , it 's prepared eight to 12 hours ahead of time , it 's mass production , '' says Lavarra . <EOS> In other words , it is n't the personalized , fussy cooking of a top-notch restaurant . <EOS> But the biggest problem is an airline 's concern for food safety , which trumps the customer 's desire for deliciousness . <EOS> `` Everything has to be pasteurized , and you ca n't use raw tuna or raw beef , '' says Lavarra . <EOS> The chef serves high-quality beef carpaccio on both his in flight and restaurant menus . <EOS> The one at the restaurant is a traditional Italian appetizer of thick slices of tender raw beef paired with ricotta and a perky tomato jam . <EOS> The same dish on the plane has to be tweaked to get around food safety regulations : the beef is seared first , so it is n't really a carpaccio anymore . <EOS> For connoisseurs , it would be the equivalent of adding water to aged whiskey . <EOS> Do n't count on the bread `` My food costs are 45 % . <EOS> I have given my food supplier list to Cathay and I believe they use the exact same ingredients as I do at Tosca , '' says Lavarra , who has had to adjust many of the other ingredients so the dishes can withstand storage and re-heating . <EOS> One item that made the chef throw in the towel was the bread . <EOS> `` It is quite tricky to make it crunchy and nice , you have to reheat it , on a flight that is basically impossible to do . <EOS> The airline caterers have done a decent job considering it is baked 15 hours in advance , but it 's not ` wow , ' '' he says . <EOS> The chef is also taking a deeper look at the overall experience for gourmets . <EOS> At the restaurant , the experience is a gradual build-up to a crescendo of a main dish . <EOS> The chef would temper the first few courses so the diner is not overwhelmed . <EOS> `` From start to end , you have to keep the interest of the customer , '' says Lavarra . <EOS> On a flight , it 's a shorter meal , with Lavarra 's special main course competing with other regular offerings . <EOS> The chef makes sure to dial up the flavors of his main dish , including the tastiest , most intense ingredients . <EOS> `` I only have one chance to impress the customer . <EOS> I have to be spot on , '' he says . <EOS> Cathay Pacific 's partnership with Pino Lavarra and Tosca runs until July 31 , 2014 , on various long-haul and regional flights departing Hong Kong .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Danish police made around 250 arrests in Copenhagen Wednesday morning as an organized demonstration against the U.N. climate talks converged on the Bella Center ahead of crucial negotiations at the COP15 summit . <EOS> Kristina Larsen , a spokeswoman for Climate Justice Action -LRB- CJA -RRB- -- the group organizing the protest -- told CNN that police have used pepper spray and dogs to contain the protests . <EOS> Around 3,000 activists convened at two railway stations in the Danish capital early on Wednesday and began their march towards the Bella Center -- the scene of the climate talks . <EOS> CJA is calling for activists to `` take over the conference for one day and transform it into a ` People 's Assembly ' . '' <EOS> At the same time protesters were marching towards the U.N. summit , a number of delegates were planning to walk out of the Bella Center . <EOS> Larsen told CNN : `` Around 300 people have marched out of the Bella Center shouting ` reclaim power ' . '' <EOS> But the planned `` People 's Assembly '' which was due to take place outside the building has , so far , been disrupted by the police . <EOS> Reporting from inside the Bella Center CNN 's Phil Black said that several hundred activists were near the perimeter of the conference center . <EOS> `` There have been some clashes and scuffles , and the police have fired some tear gas , but the protests have been reasonably low-level . '' <EOS> Black said . <EOS> CJA say they are holding a `` People 's Assembly '' to counter the `` false solutions and elitism of the U.N. climate talks . '' <EOS> A spokesman for the Copenhagen police told CNN that the majority of arrests have taken place outside the Bella Center but there have been no serious injuries . <EOS> `` The protesters detained have been taken to a temporary holding facility and most are expected to be released in the next two hours , '' the Police spokesman said . <EOS> On Sunday , police said they had detained 968 people , accusing protesters of donning facemasks , throwing fireworks and stones , breaking windows and setting vehicles alight . <EOS> A further 212 people were arrested overnight on Monday . <EOS> CJA says that protesters are engaged in `` peaceful , nonviolent protest '' and accused the police of being `` out of control . '' <EOS> `` We 've had a lot of police repression in the last couple of days , '' Larsen told CNN . <EOS> She also claimed that the environmental group Friends of the Earth had been denied access to the Bella Center on Wednesday morning . <EOS> While the protests were going on outside , inside it was being announced that Danish minister Connie Hedegaard had resigned as president of the U.N. climate change summit . <EOS> `` The resignation is essentially procedural , '' CNN 's Phil Black said , `` and she 'll be replaced by the Danish prime minister . <EOS> It 's a reflection of the fact that the talks are now at the high-level phase , and it was deemed appropriate that the PM should now take over . '' <EOS> World leaders have started arriving in Copenhagen for the final days of `` high-level '' negotiations . <EOS> British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among the first to arrive , holding talks Tuesday with Australian and Bangladeshi counterparts Kevin Rudd and Sheikh Hasina . <EOS> U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to arrive Friday . <EOS> U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told nations Tuesday that they had the chance to `` change the course of our history '' if they worked together to limit carbon emissions that are blamed for increasing global temperatures . <EOS> `` We have a chance -- a real chance , here and now -- to change the course of our history , '' he said , noting that countries had to work quickly , because nature does n't negotiate . <EOS> He urged both industrialized and developing countries to do more during this week 's Copenhagen summit toward reaching an agreement on limiting the emissions , saying they `` can and they must do more . '' <EOS> `` This is a time to stop pointing fingers , '' Ban added . <EOS> `` This is a time to start looking in the mirror and offering what they can do more of . '' <EOS> Are you in Copenhagen ? <EOS> Share your images U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote Tuesday that the United States is ready to do their part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions but that other countries , especially poorer ones , must play their parts as well . <EOS> Clinton 's assertion came as a major international summit headed into the home stretch . <EOS> `` Nearly all of the growth in emissions in the next 20 years will come from the developing world , '' Clinton wrote in an opinion piece for the International Herald Tribune . <EOS> `` Without their participation and commitment , a solution is impossible . '' <EOS> The divide between rich and poor countries is one of the key fissures at the conference . <EOS> Developing countries object to restrictions that they fear would keep them from following the same path to prosperity taken by the United States and other industrialized nations . <EOS> The man running the conference warned Tuesday that `` nowhere near enough progress '' had been made toward an agreement . <EOS> `` There is still an enormous amount of work and ground to be covered if this conference is to deliver what people around the world expect it to deliver , '' Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change , said at a news conference .
The recent convictions of Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt , Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir brings to an end this sad chapter on corruption , however , the full story will continue as names of other players were also mentioned during the trial ; they will be investigated and further action may also be taken . <EOS> Butt , Asif and Amir sold themselves for a relatively modest amount of money and in the process destroyed their careers and brought cricket and Pakistan into disrepute . <EOS> The fact that three players , possibly more , were involved is worrying ; none of them considered that what they were doing was not only wrong but also dishonest and illegal . <EOS> In Pakistan , where cricket provides a welcome distraction from the internal security threats and the terrible natural disasters the country has faced in recent years , there is a sense of outrage and anger at being let down by people who were role models for hundred of thousands of fans . <EOS> I believe that the convictions for the players were correct . <EOS> In addition to the jail sentences and fines they have all been banned for five years from any form of cricket . <EOS> I do feel sorry for teenager Amir ; while I am not convinced that he was coerced or pressurized , he was naive and in all probability did not fully appreciate what he was doing or its consequences due to his background and education . <EOS> Butt and Asif must never again play for Pakistan ; I would treat Amir 's case with more sympathy but it will be very difficult for him to get back into international cricket in five years time . <EOS> I am not happy with the sentence given to agent Mazhar Majeed ; it should have been much tougher . <EOS> For me the important question is how did this happen ; what lessons did we learn and what should the game do going forward ? <EOS> It was very clear that the three players did not understand the ethos of the game or what the spirit of cricket means . <EOS> They also callously ignored the ICC Code of Conduct on corruption and matching fixing . <EOS> The ICC has an excellent program for awareness and prevention of corruption ; so where did the message fail to get through ? <EOS> The ICC works in partnership with every cricket board to educate the players on corruption . <EOS> In this case it is clear that the Pakistan Cricket Board did not do enough . <EOS> This was a major failing and the PCB should not only accept responsibility for this but undertake to ensure that it does not happen again . <EOS> The team management had concerns about the players ' agent but failed to do anything about it . <EOS> There had been rumors about the team 's performance in Australia before the tour to England , yet no measures were taken to tighten the controls around the players and stop outside influences from having access to them . <EOS> When the News of the World broke the story , the PCB went into denial implying this was a conspiracy against the Pakistan team ; this forced the ICC to take action against the players something the PCB should itself have done . <EOS> After the match fixing scandals in the late 1990s the PCB worked very hard to eradicate corruption from the game . <EOS> Certainly , until 2006 when my term as President of the ICC came to an end , I was confident that the PCB and specifically its chairmen during my time , made great efforts to prevent and monitor corrupt practices in Pakistan cricket . <EOS> But things have gone dreadfully wrong in the past three to four years and Pakistan cricket has paid the price of a weak governance structure . <EOS> The chairman is appointed by the president of the country without a consultation process with any of the key stakeholders in the game . <EOS> The PCB chairman is not accountable to anyone ; some years ago the PCB chairman also assumed the position of chief executive and downgraded the role of the CEO to chief operating officer ; this destroyed whatever little checks and balances existed within the PCB . <EOS> Without a sound governance structure and professional management , corruption will remain a huge risk for Pakistan cricket . <EOS> I do not believe that corruption is endemic in cricket ; almost all of the Test playing countries have a robust anti-corruption regime . <EOS> During my time with the ICC I met with Paul Condon , the then chairman of the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit , for one to one briefings on corruption . <EOS> He was confident that match fixing was not taking place but was not so confident about ` spot fixing ' where one or more players could be corrupted ; this was difficult if not impossible to monitor . <EOS> These incidents can be avoided by the national cricket boards having a robust education program for the players ; appointing mentors from within the team to help and guide new players and having an effective anti-corruption units to monitor domestic as well as international cricket . <EOS> Most of the boards already do this ; unfortunately the PCB 's anti-corruption program was not effective . <EOS> The education program for the players should start when they first start playing domestic first class cricket . <EOS> For its part , the ICC must engage with the governments of countries such as India , UAE and Pakistan where a very large unregulated betting industry exits . <EOS> The epicenter of cricket betting is India ; hundreds of millions of dollars are bet on each match , particularly when India is playing . <EOS> The ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit is not able to access the betting odds being offered or monitor suspicious bets being placed . <EOS> Unless betting is regulated in these countries it will remain very difficult to stop players being approached . <EOS> I would also like to see the ICC have the powers to carry out an annual review of the anti-corruption processes of every Test playing country ; testing the players and relevant officials through annual on-line questionnaires to assess how well they understand the ICC Code of Conduct on corruption . <EOS> Where players get low scores the ICC should have the authority to require the player 's board to take remedial action and re-training of the board 's officials in-charge of educating the players . <EOS> In case of extreme failure on the part of a board to demonstrate that it has a robust anti-corruption program , the country should be suspended from international cricket until the ICC Board is satisfied that the particular country has put a robust anti-corruption regime in place .
Amid security anxieties , indignation over Russian politics , the furore over unfinished media accommodation and astronomic costs , one key component of the Winter Olympics has been all but forgotten : the thousands of athletes streaming into Sochi . <EOS> When not competing , they will spend a large chunk of their time at the Olympic Village -- the traditional home for most of those taking part . <EOS> Sochi has two to boast : one in the imposing landscape of the Caucasus mountains ; the other on the Black Sea 's sunny northern banks . <EOS> These are dwellings that resemble small towns -- you need a lot of rooms to house 6,000 athletes from 85 nations . <EOS> The coastal destination surely proves an easy sell to any would-be resident for the month of February . <EOS> If holiday brochures existed for a stay in the Olympic Village , it might read : `` Upmarket holiday camp , with pleasant residential buildings that come inclusive with very own McDonald 's , round-the-clock dining room with flavors from around the world , fully-fitted games room -- boasting table tennis , pool tables and computer games -- free bar and 24-hour gym , in great location just off the beach . <EOS> `` There are grass lawns to sit out on and enjoy the sun -LRB- the climate is so favorable they say there are only three seasons , winter is skipped on the coast -RRB- , traffic is non-existent and crime is wonderfully low . '' <EOS> Just as importantly for the athletes , their accommodation is a stone 's throw away from some of the best winter sport facilities in the world , making it possible to have your breakfast and walk to the ice rink in under 10 minutes -- a first in Winter Olympic history . <EOS> But with any holiday accommodation , and especially when you have thousands of happy campers to please , there have been a few teething problems . <EOS> So the management would like to apologize for the swimming pools not being ready -- they are currently empty of water -- and an inability to fulfil the promise of creating landscapes in and around the athletes ' blocks . <EOS> `` In the brochure the organizers provided to the teams this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary ... but I do n't think they were able to plant the trees in time , '' Team GB short-track speed skater Charlotte Gilmartin told CNN `` But apart from that everything else has been great ! '' <EOS> added Gilmartin as she follows the gravel path which navigates across an area of wasteland separating the dining facilities from her team 's apartment building . <EOS> We 'll guess from that she 'd give it a four-star rating as she crosses the road and opens the door to a building which , on every floor , has balconies festooned with British flags . <EOS> Flags which , incidentally , have already become a source of rivalry between athletes from competing nations , if the images posted on Twitter and Instagram are anything to go by -- the bigger the better . <EOS> For the duration of the Games , Gilmartin will call this home . <EOS> Once inside , after traveling up four flights in an elevator that still has that freshly-installed smell , we walk down a clean , window-lit passageway to a door that has a Union Jack flag doormat daubed with a `` Welcome '' message . <EOS> Gilmartin 's airy , open-plan room consists of two single beds -- she shares it with a teammate -- with sea views from a decent-sized balcony , a modern bathroom , double-glazed windows , storage cupboards and an ample lounge area with television . <EOS> Orange bikes As with all Olympic Games , the organizers provide teams with a fully functional room with basic furniture -- similar in quality to a well-known Swedish brand by the look of it -- and then allow the respective Olympic associations to adorn the rooms as they see fit . <EOS> In Team GB 's case , this entails some patriotic pictures hung on the wall , the provision of `` good luck '' cuddly toys , themed cushions and the aforementioned doormat . <EOS> Despite reports of pillow shortages in the mountain cluster village , both beds boast two cushions apiece . <EOS> Each room 's crowning glory is surely the uniquely patterned quilt for the beds that can then be taken home afterwards by competitors as a souvenir -- as is traditional for all Games The 2014 quilts are light-blue with stitched diamonds of colored flowers . <EOS> Very nice . <EOS> Very Russian . <EOS> So if there have been problems with hotels occupied by journalists , it seems the Winter Games athletes are having a very different experience . <EOS> `` After five days I have no problems , '' says Russian speed skater Ekaterina Lobysheva -- a veteran of three Olympic Games -- speaking to CNN over a lunch of Chinese noodles . <EOS> `` And the food is very good . <EOS> I prefer Asian and Italian food , which is good because they have a cook here from Italy too . <EOS> `` I 'm lucky , I do n't really have a diet because I use so many calories . <EOS> This is the first time my country has hosted the Winter Games and I hope these facilities will help popularize my sport . '' <EOS> Finnish ice hockey player Susanna Tapan also gave the accommodation the thumbs up . <EOS> `` It 's very exciting . <EOS> This is my first Olympics , and I 'm enjoying it very much so far . <EOS> The accommodation has been great . '' <EOS> One of the most striking attractions of the village is the way different nations bring their own distinctive characteristics . <EOS> Most notably the Dutch , who are pedaling around on orange bikes . <EOS> There may not be the recording studio that London 2012 laid on for the athletes , but between the gym , the bar , the dining room , the pool tables and the beach , there is plenty to keep them occupied . <EOS> And if spectators find their hotels are closer to the standard of the athletes ' village compared to that of the media accommodation , we might even start to get excited about the great sporting prospect that awaits . <EOS> Let the Games begin !
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With this summer 's heat already blamed for at least 22 deaths , the recent heat wave continues to claim victims as it settles over portions of the East Coast this weekend . <EOS> On Friday , Tennessee reported four confirmed heat-related deaths , said a spokesman for the health department in Shelby County . <EOS> The deaths are not yet included in the National Weather Service 's count of 22 . <EOS> Chicago confirmed six heat-related deaths Friday , according to Roderick Drew , a spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management and Communications . <EOS> The four men and two women , all over the age of 45 , suffered from various heart-related conditions and all had heat stress listed as a secondary cause of death , according to Drew . <EOS> Also Thursday , Kansas City confirmed that a man 's death on June 5 was heat-related . <EOS> The 57-year-old man was found dead in his home , according to Dan Ferguson , who works for Jackson County . <EOS> It was not clear if his death was included in the weather service 's count . <EOS> Missouri has reported 13 other possible heat-related deaths , with the youngest victim being a woman in her mid-30s and the oldest two women in their mid-70s , said Jeff Hershberger , a spokesman for the Kansas City Health Department . <EOS> It may take six weeks to several months for officials to process toxicology tests to determine if all 13 died of heat-related causes , Hershberger said . <EOS> In Wisconsin , a 65-year-old man from Fountain Prairie was confirmed by health officials to have died from heat-related causes Thursday , according to CNN affiliate WKOW . <EOS> Columbia County Medical Examiner Angela Hinze said the man had underlying medical conditions that were made worse when he helped a family member outside with housework . <EOS> In Oklahoma , four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May , said Cherokee Ballard , a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner . <EOS> Three of those occurred in the past 30 days , including the death of a 3-year-old boy in a car in Norman and a 69-year-old man from Blackwell , she said . <EOS> An additional eight Oklahoma deaths -- most of them occurring this month -- may be related to the heat , she said . <EOS> The National Weather Service issued an extreme heat warning for much of the Middle Atlantic States , saying Friday would be the hottest day in the region . <EOS> The highest heat index values -- how hot it feels -- could reach 115 degrees in some locations , it said . <EOS> `` These triple-digit temperatures are forecast to remain in place across the eastern U.S. through Saturday , '' it said . <EOS> The weather was expected to cool off slightly to the mid-90s by Sunday , according to the National Weather Service . <EOS> On Friday , Newark , New Jersey , recorded its highest temperature since record-keeping began , the National Weather Service said . <EOS> The temperature hit 108 degrees by Friday evening . <EOS> The previous all-time high in Newark was recorded on August 9 , 2001 , at 105 degrees , the service said . <EOS> Record-keeping in the city began in 1931 . <EOS> Millions of people were being warned to avoid strenuous activity and outdoor exercise after the National Weather Service issued a number of code red air quality alerts -- meaning air pollution levels are considered unhealthy for the general population -- in a handful of cities , including Baltimore and Washington , D.C. . <EOS> About 100 people , primarily teenagers , were overcome by the heat Thursday at the Vans Warped Tour in Camden , New Jersey , where more than 12,000 people gathered at the outdoor concert , authorities said . <EOS> `` I just , I guess got overheated and I got really dizzy , '' 17-year-old Maureen Meckly , who attended the concert , told CNN affiliate KYW-TV . <EOS> `` I had to grab on to -LRB- my friend 's -RRB- shoulder to tell her I was passing out . '' <EOS> In Chicago , residents have opened an estimated 2,000 fire hydrants since June 18 to get relief from the heat , according to Drew . <EOS> Drew says the open hydrants are a public safety issue because they will lower water pressure and decrease the fire department 's ability to fight fire . <EOS> That did n't stop Marc Santiago , 49 , of Chicago , from taking advantage of the situation . <EOS> He took out a bar of soap and took a shower in the middle of the street , dodging traffic . <EOS> Santiago said the open hydrant dropped the water pressure in his home , preventing him from taking a shower inside , and `` I had to take a bath . '' <EOS> The city emergency management team warned citizens planning weekend outdoor activities to take every precaution . <EOS> `` We advise all residents ... to stay cool , drink plenty of fluids and dress appropriately to handle the heat , '' said Gary Schenkel , the executive director of the Emergency Management Office in a statement Friday . <EOS> In New York , Con Edison called on customers to stay cool and not waste energy . <EOS> The city 's electricity service hit a new record Friday afternoon for 13,189 megawatts used , said spokesman Chris Olert . <EOS> There are 1,700 outages in the city , he said . <EOS> CNN 's Divina Mims , Chris Welch , Sean Morris , Jacqui Jeras , Dave Alsup , Phil Gast , Chelsea J.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree , obstacles abound . <EOS> Issues of finance , time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams . <EOS> Palestinian Sawsan Salameh is attending an Israeli university after years of negotiations and court proceedings . <EOS> For Sawsan Salameh , the obstacles also involved politics . <EOS> Several years ago , Salameh , a 31-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Anata , was granted a scholarship to study at Hebrew University of Jerusalem . <EOS> Although her town is only a few miles from the university , access to the school was out of reach because of an Israeli military ban that limited Palestinian students ' access to Israeli universities , on security grounds . <EOS> But she was far from giving up on her goal of pursuing her education . <EOS> `` When I was in high school , it was a dream that I should finish my Ph.D. , '' Salameh said . <EOS> After obtaining a master 's degree at Al Quds University , a Palestinian school in the West Bank , Salameh was granted full scholarships at several international schools , including Hebrew University . <EOS> With the military ban in place , Salameh considered studying at a university abroad . <EOS> `` I started to think I should get up and take this offer to leave , but it 's not easy to go abroad , and the only chance is for me to study in Israel , because it 's important for me to stay close to my family , '' Salameh said . <EOS> Salameh sought the support of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha , which submitted a petition to Israel 's Supreme Court on her behalf in 2006 . <EOS> The Supreme Court responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow Salameh to study at Hebrew University , where she is pursuing a Ph.D. in pharmacology . <EOS> `` We argued Sawsan 's case for 2 years , and at the end of the day , the military agreed to let Sawsan study , '' said Sari Bashi , director of Gisha . <EOS> `` It was impossible to deny her incredible talents and the example she set for women and girls throughout the West Bank , '' Bashi says . <EOS> The Israeli military agreed to review all future requests for Palestinians in the West Bank wishing to pursue a degree at an Israeli university on a case-by-case basis , based on specific criteria . <EOS> The criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks , that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence , and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to Israel , says Maj. Guy Inbar , spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories . <EOS> The area of study must be supported by an international organization -LRB- such as the U.N. or the Red Cross -RRB- and approved by the Ministry of Education and must also be a degree unique to an Israeli university -LRB- not offered at a Palestinian university -RRB- . <EOS> The request must come with a recommendation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to Inbar . <EOS> After Salameh 's victory , Gisha , with the support of a number of Israeli academics , further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations . <EOS> The Israeli military 's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict . <EOS> In July 2002 , a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of Hebrew University , killing seven people . <EOS> The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the explosion , according to Palestinian sources . <EOS> Still , some academics at Hebrew University believe qualified students like Salameh pose no security risk , and their acceptance to Israeli universities could even foster better relations in the region . <EOS> Professor Alon Harel , a law professor at Hebrew University , pushed for the appeal to lift the military 's criteria on Palestinian students . <EOS> He believes that the admission of Palestinian students from the West Bank would enrich the academic environment at the university , particularly in the study of law . <EOS> `` It 's particularly important for classes to be diverse , for people to have familiarity with Arabic studies and Islamic law , '' he said . <EOS> Other academics agree that qualified students such as Salameh can only add to the diversity of the campus , where thousands of Israeli Arab students are enrolled . <EOS> `` My personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow Palestinian students to study at Hebrew University , '' said Yaacov Schul , vice rector at Hebrew University . <EOS> Salameh is a devout Muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood . <EOS> `` Everyday I have to hear something about -LSB- not being married -RSB- from relatives and aunts , '' she says . <EOS> `` It 's become -LSB- the -RSB- usual . '' <EOS> Salameh , who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women 's center she opened in her community , says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals . <EOS> `` I get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the West Bank who ask me how to apply to universities in Israel , '' Salameh said . <EOS> `` Maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree , '' she said . <EOS> Salameh says she enjoys the collegial atmosphere at Hebrew University , where she studies among Israeli Arab , international and Israeli students . <EOS> She is considering pursuing another degree after completing her Ph.D. in two years . <EOS> `` I would like to help other people , and I hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier , '' she said .

'' <EOS> `` We call it Lite Feet '' Saunders is the founder of WAFFLE -LRB- We are Family for Life Entertainment -RRB- , a group of 15 dancers whose gravity-defying pole pirouettes -- accompanied by thumping beatbox tunes -- have earned them quite a reputation on the city 's subway . <EOS> Every week the young men -- aged between 17 and 21 -- perform their special brand of breakdancing turned ballet on the underground trains ; delighting , bemusing , and sometimes infuriating commuters . <EOS> The urban acrobats swing from handrails or backflip down aisles , with the ease and bravado of youngsters who grew up using the city as a giant dance floor . <EOS> `` Chicken Noodle Soup , '' `` Needle and Thread , '' `` Walking on Air '' -- these are the names of some of WAFFLE 's signature moves , performed with a cheeky swagger to their own mish-mash recordings of hip hop , funk , and electro beats . <EOS> `` The way we move -- our energy , our shoe tricks , our hat tricks -- is something that 's completely new , '' said Saunders . <EOS> `` We call it ` Lite Feet ' -- it 's a mixture of dances put together , '' he added . <EOS> `` There 's this dance , the ` Charleston ' -LRB- made popular in the 1920s -RRB- , and that 's one of the closest things we 've been able to find to it . '' <EOS> `` Everyone has an opinion '' `` It 's showtime ! '' <EOS> has become something of a rallying cry for the buskers , who usually split into smaller groups of three , targeting the busiest carriages to earn up to $ 100 a day . <EOS> Watch one of the many YouTube clips of the dancers expertly twirling their caps on a perfectly poised elbow or nonchalantly `` Moonwalking '' along a trundling train , and the reactions are as varied as New Yorkers themselves -- grandmothers cheer , hipsters appear bored , and tourists scramble for their phones . <EOS> `` There are a lot of copycats out there now , '' says Saunders , who first started busking seven years ago . <EOS> `` Everyone has an opinion . <EOS> But this is how we make a living , so we do n't have to ask our parents for money or have a boring job . <EOS> We 're just trying to do something positive . '' <EOS> Not everyone sees their shows in the same light , with a New York Times article on the troupe attracting some unfavorable comments . <EOS> `` They definitely have some impressive moves . <EOS> They are also extremely annoying , and more importantlydangerous , '' wrote Josh F. Has Saunders ever hurt anyone during his act ? <EOS> `` No . <EOS> Just a little graze , but I 've never really hit anyone , '' he said . <EOS> `` People do n't know I 've been doing it for years . <EOS> I know what I 'm doing . '' <EOS> From Bronx to big time ? <EOS> It was as young teens growing up in low income households in Harlem , Brooklyn and the Bronx , that Saunders and his fancy-footed friends first came up with the idea of busking as a way to raise money to attend local dance competitions -- or `` battles . '' <EOS> `` You had to pay $ 10 to get in , so asking your mom every week got annoying . <EOS> Or they probably wo n't have the money to give to you right away .

Reno , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Mass casualties '' were reported at an air show after a plane slammed into the box seat area in front of a grandstand at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show in Reno on Friday , a spokesman for the show told CNN . <EOS> At least two people died and 54 people were transported from the scene with injuries , according to officials . <EOS> The pilot , identified as Jimmy Leeward , a real estate developer from Ocala , Florida , was likely killed in the crash , the show said in a statement . <EOS> He was flying a P-51 Mustang . <EOS> The event has been canceled and a memorial service will be held for the pilot Saturday afternoon , the show said . <EOS> Leeward speaks the day before the crash A Reno hospital said Friday night on its website that it had received a `` total of 25 patients '' after the plane crashed . <EOS> It said two people , one male and one female , had died . <EOS> It was not immediately clear whether that figure counted the pilot . <EOS> The patients included twelve people in critical condition , meaning their vital signs are unstable `` and not within normal limits , '' and 11 in fair condition , exhibiting stable vital signs , according to the 7:30 p.m. PT update on the Renown Regional Medical Center website . <EOS> The hospital also noted that four patients being treated at Renown South Medical Center were in fair condition . <EOS> Mike Houghton , president of the Reno Air Racing Association , told reporters that 54 people were transported from the scene with injuries . <EOS> Video of the crash , posted on YouTube , showed a plane plummeting from the sky , sending up clouds of dust and debris . <EOS> Shocked spectators rose to their feet . <EOS> Fred Scholz , a witness , said he saw the plane seemingly `` coming straight down . '' <EOS> `` I thought he was coming right on top of us , '' he said , noting that the aircraft ultimately hit about 100 feet from him , in an area of box seats , filled with folding chairs . <EOS> `` Luckily there was no fire , which surprised me , '' said Scholz , a 59-year-old from Truckee , California , who says he goes to air races ever year . <EOS> `` It just happened so quickly . '' <EOS> Scholz : We were deer in headlights Another witness , Greg Mills , added that the pilot `` did n't have enough altitude to pull up , '' with the aircraft shuddering before slamming to the ground about 50 to 75 yards from where he was standing . <EOS> `` We got showered by little stuff , '' said Mills , who works at the Pacific Aviation Museum based in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , describing a chaotic scene afterward . <EOS> `` Everybody was running . '' <EOS> The plane , called the `` Galloping Ghost , '' was taking part in a qualifying round in the `` unlimited class '' division of the air race when it went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday , said Mike Draper , the show spokesman . <EOS> The final rounds had been slated for the weekend . <EOS> The aircraft was about a lap into the race when the pilot sent out a `` Mayday signal '' and pulled `` out of the lap '' before crashing into a box seat area that is in front of a grandstand at the `` very large race field , '' located about 15 miles north of Reno , Draper said . <EOS> `` It was clear that -LRB- the plane -RRB- was pulling up and was in distress , '' he said . <EOS> He added that authorities do not yet know why the aircraft went down . <EOS> Besides the Federal Aviation Administration personnel already there to assist the National Transportation Safety Board in any investigation , the show 's spokesman said that National Guard members -- who were on-site practicing before the incident -- are helping emergency personnel to clear the area . <EOS> `` There are people still being escorted out of that area with various injuries , '' Draper said . <EOS> Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told CNN that `` 700 or 800 emergency personnel showed up in a matter of minutes . '' <EOS> `` You could n't believe how fast they came , '' said Cashell , adding that citizens and some troops on site also helped with the injured . <EOS> `` Just watching these people and the way they responded , and it 's been magnificent . '' <EOS> Local fire officials are reporting multiple fatalities and critical injuries , according to Ian Gregor , a spokesman with the FAA . <EOS> He said the aircraft did not catch fire , but there was a wide debris field following the crash . <EOS> Gary Arthur , another witness to the accident , said the plane wavered a few times , suggesting the pilot had tried to get control before going down . <EOS> `` Just the sound of the impact was unbelievable , '' he said . <EOS> `` Almost ca n't believe you saw what actually happened . '' <EOS> In 2007 , a mid-air collision during the annual National Championship Air Races in Reno claimed the life of one of the two pilots involved . <EOS> The collision was the latest in a string of accidents that plagued the races that week , killing three pilots . <EOS> CNN 's Mike Ahlers , Kelly Marshall Smoot , Greg Morrison and Nick Valencia contributed to this report .
Decatur , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Given all their country and people have been through , between political upheavals , human rights abuses , hurricanes , abject poverty and last week 's earthquake , `` If Haitians were constantly questioning their faith , they would all be atheists . '' <EOS> These words came from the Rev. Eric Hill as he prepared to lead Haitian Mass Sunday at Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Decatur , Georgia . <EOS> Some of the 100 Haitian parishioners who gathered raised their hands to the heavens in praise , grateful their loved ones had been found . <EOS> Others bowed their heads and clenched their hands for those lost , still missing and all who suffered . <EOS> One woman wept out of guilt because she -- a U.S. citizen -- had been able to leave her devastated homeland a day after the quake , while so many were left behind . <EOS> Their unshaken faith and devotion to God is the same sort that 's played out in other houses of worship , in living rooms and on the torn-up streets of Haiti . <EOS> Are you in Haiti and safe ? <EOS> Share your story , photos with CNN iReport Carmella Delerme of Miami , Florida , said her mother clung to her Bible for days , reading psalms over and over again , as they waited for word on the whereabouts and condition of Delerme 's sister and other relatives . <EOS> When her sister , who was in Haiti on a missionary trip with their Seventh-day Adventist Church , called late Thursday , Delerme said , `` I went straight to church and prayed and prayed and prayed . <EOS> We continue to pray for those who are lost and still in need . '' <EOS> On the streets of Port-au-Prince , with many of their churches crumbled , people have gathered to worship and sing Catholic and Protestant hymns . <EOS> `` That 's the soundscape of the country right now , '' said Elizabeth McAlister , a professor of religion and anthropologist of Haiti who teaches at Wesleyan University in Connecticut . <EOS> `` It 's the business of religion to create meaning out of chaos . <EOS> ... Tragically , the business of religion is getting a lot of trade today . '' <EOS> See complete coverage of Haiti earthquake It 's often said that 80 percent of Haitians are Catholic , although other estimates range from 55 percent to 85 percent . <EOS> McAlister , who puts her best estimate at 70 percent , said getting a proper census in Haiti to nail down numbers is impossible . <EOS> But between Protestant denominations and Catholicism , it is without doubt a majority Christian country , she said . <EOS> Weaved in , however , are the nuances that come with the country 's troubled history . <EOS> Colonized by the French , the land then known as Saint-Domingue emerged as one of the wealthiest colonies of the 18th century . <EOS> It 's flourishing sugar production and aggressive deforestation was achieved on the backs of half a million African slaves . <EOS> They brought with them their own belief systems , rooted in West and Central African traditions . <EOS> Haitian Vodou , often misunderstood and branded with stereotypes , has its own ceremonies and rituals meant to honor spirits , or loas . <EOS> These spirits , seen as intermediaries with God and links to ancestors , can be called upon for help . <EOS> And for practicing Christians , especially Catholics who can view saints as they would spirits , the two systems do not have to be mutually exclusive . <EOS> Not everyone is necessarily practicing Vodou , commonly anglicized as Voodoo , but McAlister said the Afro-Creole Haitian traditions are usually kept alive and the ancestral spirits are inherited by at least one member of every family . <EOS> Haitian-born Leslie Desmangles remembered being hurt as a boy by the words of Christian missionaries who misunderstood and demonized his peoples ' traditions . <EOS> Theirs were sentiments much like those uttered last week by televangelist Pat Robertson who said the Haitian people are `` cursed '' because they `` swore a pact with the devil '' to get out from under French rule . <EOS> Robertson 's comments were `` insensitive , theologically unsound and loaded with racial connotations , '' said Desmangles , a professor of religion and international studies at Trinity College in Connecticut . <EOS> In the Decatur church Sunday , the priest reminded his congregants that theirs is an all-loving God , not a vindictive one . <EOS> Their God , he said , is in the international outpouring of support from people who , one week ago , did n't know where Haiti was . <EOS> Their God is a rock of stability when the earth trembles . <EOS> Their God is the one who lifts them up `` to mend our broken bones , to brush us off and to bury the dead , '' Hill said . <EOS> And during this first Sunday Mass after the earthquake , their God was in the music that moved them . <EOS> To the distinctly Caribbean sounds of their band and choir , they sang hymns of praise to the one they believe stands with them . <EOS> `` People continue to be God 's instruments , '' the pastor said , with the help of a Creole translator . <EOS> `` God will work through all of us to bring new life to Haiti . '' <EOS> As he spoke , a little girl , too young to understand the pain around her , did what she could . <EOS> She planted kisses on the forehead of her anguished father , his face buried in his hands , before skipping off to make fish faces and giggle with other children .
It has all the trappings of a trashy romance novel : a flamboyant billionaire media tycoon enthralled by a leggy Moroccan exotic dancer nicknamed `` Ruby Heartbreaker . '' <EOS> But this is real life , and the sex scandal involving former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and the dancer , Karima El Mahroug , has been a tabloid headline writer 's dream . <EOS> Read more : Berlusconi 's ` bunga bunga ' women testify at his trial The now-76-year-old Berlusconi is accused of having sex 13 times with El Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17 , which normally would n't be a problem since the age of consent in Italy is 14 . <EOS> But sex with a prostitute under 18 is a crime there . <EOS> El Mahroug was expected to take the stand Monday in Berlusconi 's trial on charges that he hired her for sex and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft . <EOS> But while Berlusconi has said that both allegations are attempts to smear him , members of his defense team declined to question El Mahroug when she appeared in court Monday , and they told her she could leave . <EOS> After El Mahroug left the courtroom , the prosecutor asked the court to use her testimony from the investigation period as evidence instead . <EOS> Berlusconi lawyer Nicolo Ghedini told reporters that his team decided not to interrogate El Mahroug because of worries that any responses or debate in court could cause tension during the hotly contested campaign leading up to Italy 's national elections next month . <EOS> Read more : Berlusconi under fire for controversial comments about Italy The performer , who has since appeared scantily clad in photographs across the country , told the Italian news channel Sky TG24 about two years ago that she had lied about her age before meeting Berlusconi for a dinner party at his private residence near Milan . <EOS> `` He knew that I was 24 years old because I told everyone that I was 24 years old , '' El Mahroug said . <EOS> `` I did n't want people to know that I was a minor . '' <EOS> It was during that first encounter on Valentine 's Day in 2010 that she said she received 7,000 euros -LRB- about $ 9,375 -RRB- after a friend informed Berlusconi that she needed help . <EOS> Berlusconi : Italy 's most colorful , controversial public figure Both have denied allegations of having sex . <EOS> `` Absolutely no , '' El Mahroug said . <EOS> `` I just arrived in Milan , and it was a little difficult living there , '' and Berlusconi gave her the money to help support herself financially , she said . <EOS> The friend `` spoke with -LRB- Berlusconi -RRB- and explained my situation , my story , my family situation , '' she said . <EOS> `` And he helped me . '' <EOS> Investigators say they later questioned the dancer 's former roommate , who claimed El Mahroug had confided in her , describing the details of her sexual relationship with the Italian premier . <EOS> ` Bunga bunga ' parties In addition to the charges against Berlusconi , three of his associates are accused of selecting up to 33 young women , including El Mahroug , to attend so-called bunga bunga parties at Berlusconi 's house , where the women would perform erotic dances before the prime minister chose one to spend the night with . <EOS> Read more : Prosecutors : Businessman got women for Berlusconi Berlusconi , who served three times as Italy 's prime minister , laughed off the allegations in a 2011 interview with a leading Italian newspaper . <EOS> `` I 'm 75 , and even if I 'm a bit mischievous , 33 girls in two months is too much even for someone who is 30 , '' the daily La Repubblica quoted him as saying . <EOS> Just to keep things interesting , last month , on an Italian talk show , the former prime minister announced plans to marry a television showgirl-turned-politician a half-century younger . <EOS> Francesca Pascale , 27 , is `` a girl who is beautiful on the outside , but even more beautiful on the inside , '' Berlusconi said . <EOS> Planning a comeback In recent months , Berlusconi has been plotting his political resurrection , agreeing to an electoral pact with the right-wing Northern League . <EOS> It 's a development that could lead to no outright winner in the country 's parliamentary elections in February . <EOS> Opinion : What does Silvio 's return mean for Italy ? <EOS> Berlusconi 's defense team asked the court Monday to suspend the trial until after the election because Berlusconi is busy with the campaign and is not able to attend . <EOS> The prosecutor called the request politically motivated . <EOS> The latest opinion polls show Berlusconi 's party and the Northern League gaining ground on the center-left coalition , but still trailing . <EOS> He said that in the event of their victory he could be willing to serve as finance minister , and he proposed Angelino Alfano , his party secretary , as prime minister . <EOS> However , Berlusconi could conceivably become prime minister for a fourth time . <EOS> The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 21 . <EOS> Then , the judge will announce his decision on the defense 's request to call more witnesses , including two international celebrities : American actor George Clooney and Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo . <EOS> Berlusconi , a billionaire media tycoon , has survived scandal before . <EOS> He has been accused of embezzlement , fraud and bribery over his career , but a tax evasion case marked the first time he was convicted of an offense . <EOS> In October , a Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to four years in prison for tax evasion . <EOS> However , under the Italian legal system , he and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice , in the appeals court and a higher court . <EOS> Also , because the case dates to July 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire this year , meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time .
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan , fiscal deal maker ? <EOS> That 's the latest incarnation of the congressman from Wisconsin , who has glided between his role as fiscal wonk to 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate to potential 2016 presidential candidate . <EOS> Ryan was one-half of the bipartisan duo that unveiled a budget deal Tuesday evening that would set spending levels for the next two years -- just days before a deadline to settle the matter . <EOS> `` This agreement makes sure that we do n't have a government shutdown scenario in January . <EOS> It makes sure we do n't have another government shutdown scenario in October . <EOS> It makes sure that we do n't lurch from crisis to crisis , '' Ryan said . <EOS> Budget deal aims to avert another shutdown The compromise deal is significant in large part because agreement was reached -- not an easy feat amid deep partisan divides in Congress , where lawmakers have failed to reach a budget accord numerous times since 2011 , including one instance that led to a 16-day government shutdown in October . <EOS> Low profile After being on the losing presidential ticket , Ryan kept a low profile . <EOS> He even remained largely silent in October while Republicans and Democrats battled over a federal shutdown and how to move forward on a government funding bill . <EOS> His reticence was more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise . <EOS> He is known in Congress as the budget wonk , the expert on the federal government and spending . <EOS> His colleagues look to him for guidance . <EOS> In recent years , he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare . <EOS> His budgets , titled `` Path to Prosperity , '' became the defining documents for Republican fiscal policy . <EOS> Silence shattered Ryan slowly started to reinsert himself when his party was flailing during the government shutdown . <EOS> He broke his months-long silence with an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in October , where he implored both sides to sit down at the negotiating table . <EOS> Patty Murray emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal After the government reopened , Ryan appeared to take his own advice . <EOS> As head of the House Budget Committee , he led negotiations with his counterpart in the Senate to reach a government spending deal for the remainder of fiscal year 2014 . <EOS> While the budget did not address the benefit programs -- Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid -- that Ryan wants to reform , it did avert another government management crisis . <EOS> With the announcement of this deal , Ryan has reemerged to be a central figure within the GOP . <EOS> Now the more pressing question is : Will the GOP still follow him ? <EOS> The dilemma As recently as last year , Ryan was considered a tried-and-true conservative . <EOS> He was able to bridge the gap between the two dividing components within the GOP . <EOS> He both won the praise of tea party supporters and had the ears of party leaders . <EOS> That 's because Ryan is a true conservative . <EOS> Twenty years ago , he worked for the conservative organization Empower America , which later became FreedomWorks . <EOS> Since then , the organization has successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited-government tea party-aligned group . <EOS> But his support might not be in lockstep . <EOS> FreedomWorks sent an advisory to Republican lawmakers Tuesday urging them to vote against Ryan 's deal . <EOS> And many Republican members have already panned the deal . <EOS> Rep. Tim Huelskamp , R-Kansas , said he would not vote for it because it `` raises spending . <EOS> There 's no way around it . '' <EOS> The budget deal in plain English `` I do n't know how a deal is good for conservatives or for America if the spending is going to go up , '' Huelskamp said on CNN 's `` Crossfire . '' <EOS> Republican strategist and former Mitt Romney spokesman Ryan Williams has said that Ryan 's October op-ed shows that he 's `` the adult in the room . '' <EOS> `` He felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we 're witnessing in Washington , '' Williams added . <EOS> 2016 ambitions ? <EOS> While speculation only grew louder that Ryan would run for the Republican presidential nomination , with trips in recent months to Iowa and New Hampshire , the first presidential nominating states , a high-profile role in Congress -- especially as a deal maker -- could be both a political risk and benefit . <EOS> It will depend on the mood of the country and the influence of the Republican right .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- By now , both the rules and deadly consequences of NekNominate -- the online drinking game of one-upmanship that has already resulted in at least five deaths -- have gone viral . <EOS> The game has players sharing videos of themselves downing boozy concoctions , usually mixed with something daringly repulsive , and challenging their friends to top the result . <EOS> In recent weeks , a new version of NekNominate has started to make the rounds , this one inviting people to do an act of good will . <EOS> It has gone under many headers ; some folks have reappropriated NekNominate , others call it RAKNominate -LRB- for Random Acts of Kindness -RRB- . <EOS> The charity-driven trend originated in South Africa , where a handful of people horrified by the drinking game decided to give it a new slant . <EOS> One of those who started the trend was Brent Lindeque , a brand activation specialist who was NekNominated by a friend . <EOS> Rather than getting drunk , he decided to use his nomination to feed a homeless person . <EOS> `` I 'd only viewed two -LSB- NekNominate -RSB- videos . <EOS> One was of a gentleman from England urinating into a cup . <EOS> He added beer and drank it all down . <EOS> The second was of an aggressive man who bit the head off a chicken -- a baby chicken -- and swallowed it before he drank his beer . <EOS> I could n't understand why people were putting something so ridiculous online , '' he recalls . <EOS> `` When I was NekNominated , I wanted to do something different that could be filtered into my circle of friends . <EOS> If I fed one person , hopefully the people I NekNominated would do the same , '' he adds . <EOS> He did n't imagine the video would get much traction beyond his circle . <EOS> He was wrong . <EOS> Since posting it on YouTube last month , Lindeque 's video has garnered over 755,000 views . <EOS> He has also attracted an additional 7,000 Twitter followers . <EOS> He has since used the video as a launchpad for a social media campaign -LRB- #changeonething -RRB- , a weekly radio segment and , perhaps soon , a charity foundation . <EOS> `` The foundation will hopefully go live in March . <EOS> It 's kind of a dating site for charities , where they can have a profile and list their needs on a micro level , '' he explains . <EOS> So far , thousands have been inspired by his video -LRB- he estimates that he has already received over 100,000 emails from people who have continued what he started -RRB- . <EOS> Big brands , including Nandos and South African Breweries , have also followed suit . <EOS> `` One beautiful story I was sent was from a man in England who went into a grocery store and bought a bunch of food . <EOS> He saw a homeless man and gave him the food , then asked him to hold the camera while he took off a jacket his father had given to him and gave it to the man , '' he recalls . <EOS> The movement has struck a particular chord in South Africa , where others , oblivious to Lindeque 's efforts , have taken a similar stance with NekNominations . <EOS> Ashton Hayes , a digital marketing strategist , decided to use the concept to help rebuild his neighbor 's house after a fire incinerated the roof . <EOS> `` The fire happened in December , and by January , nothing had been done . <EOS> There were a few funds that had been raised , but not enough to repair the roof , which had burned . <EOS> That 's when the idea came to NekNominate and help her out that way , '' he recalls . <EOS> He created a video profiling his neighbor , Elizabeth , who also looks after 14 orphaned children in her Cape Town home . <EOS> At the end , he NekNominated all of South Africa to do their part . <EOS> In two days , he 'd raised the required funds -- $ 4,000 . <EOS> One of the most touching stories he heard was of a 10-year old boy who donated the money he was saving to buy a Lego set to help Elizabeth rebuild her home . <EOS> Local store Builders Warehouse was also nominated to chip in , and they responded by donating the tools to get the job done . <EOS> `` The reason this works so well in South Africa is because there 's so much need for this sort of thing , '' Hayes speculates . <EOS> `` People here are looking for ways to help out , and the answers are n't always right in front of them . <EOS> This gives them an excuse , and there 's also a sense of urgency about it , because they have to complete the nominations within 24 hours , '' he says .
A well known leader of an anti-government `` sovereign citizens '' group was indicted Tuesday in Montgomery , Alabama , for tax crimes , the Justice Department announced . <EOS> A 10-count indictment charges James Timothy Turner with conspiracy to defraud the United States , attempting to pay taxes with fictitious financial instruments , attempting to obstruct the Internal Revenue Service , failure to file federal tax returns and giving false testimony in a bankruptcy proceeding . <EOS> The government says Turner , the self-proclaimed president of a sovereign-citizens group called Republic for the united States of America , was arrested Tuesday and had a brief court appearance . <EOS> Turner will remain in jail pending a Monday detention hearing , according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Alabama . <EOS> According to the indictment , Turner allegedly tried to pay his 2008 taxes with a $ 300 million fake bond and assisted others trying to pay taxes with up to $ 100 billion dollars in fraudulent bonds . <EOS> Prosecutors also said Turner gave seminars teaching others how to defraud the IRS and to file retaliatory liens against government officials . <EOS> Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said Turner 's sovereign citizens group rejects the authority of the government and its ability to enforce laws and collect taxes . <EOS> Potok said that in late 2010 the group sent letters to governors in all 50 states calling on them to step down . <EOS> The taxes charges brought against Turner carry a maximum of 164 years in prison as well as large financial penalties if he is convicted . <EOS> CNN was not able to identify a lawyer representing Turner .

Gay men who 've abstained from sex for one year would be able to donate blood in 2015 , ending a lifetime ban for the gay community , under a proposed FDA policy change unveiled Tuesday . <EOS> The current lifetime ban by U.S. Food and Drug Administration states dates back to 1983 and forbids men who have had sex with men from becoming blood donors because the group is `` at increased risk for HIV , hepatitis B and certain other infections that can be transmitted by transfusion , '' the FDA has ruled . <EOS> But the FDA is now seeking a change in that policy and would allow such blood donations based on an independent expert advisory panel 's recommendation , the agency said . <EOS> The proposed change would align the one-year deferral period `` with that of other men and women at increased risk for HIV infection , '' the FDA said . <EOS> The agency will be gathering public comments on the proposed change . <EOS> `` We encourage all stakeholders to take this opportunity to provide any information the agency should consider , and look forward to receiving and reviewing these comments , '' FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg said in a statement . <EOS> The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the FDA would monitor a national blood surveillance system to see any effects of the proposed policy change and to ensure the continued safety of the blood supply , Hamburg said . <EOS> `` A history of male-to-male sex is associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of certain infectious diseases , including HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , '' the FDA said . <EOS> Men who have had sex with other men represent approximately 2 % of the U.S. population , yet are the population most severely affected by HIV , according to the FDA . <EOS> In 2010 , male-to-male sex accounted for at least 61 % of all new HIV infections in the United States , and `` an estimated 77 % of diagnosed HIV infections among males were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact , '' the FDA said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Irish government ordered a recall Saturday of all pork products linked to pigs slaughtered in Ireland , after laboratory tests found the presence of dioxins in animal feed and pork fat samples . <EOS> Preliminary evidence gathered by Ireland 's Food Safety Authority indicated that the contamination likely started in September , the government said in a statement . <EOS> The Food Safety Authority advised consumers not to consume Irish pork and bacon products for the time being . <EOS> The government is now trying to determine the scope of the contamination . <EOS> Dioxins are environmental contaminants , often present in industrial waste . <EOS> Most dioxin exposure occurs through diet , with more than 95 percent coming from the consumption of animal fats , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . <EOS> Dioxin levels in food are regulated . <EOS> Dr Tony Holohan , Ireland 's Chief Medical Officer , said that the dioxin usually impacts the nervous system and liver in comments reported by the UK Press Association . <EOS> Holohan added that the dioxin would only be perilous through prolonged exposure . <EOS> The agency reported that an animal feed ingredient supplied by one business to 40-plus farms is regarded as the likely cause of the dioxin by experts , and that tests revealed the dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls to be 80 to 200 times above the acceptable safety level .
The South Korean government announced expanded sanctions against Iran Friday , blacklisting more than 100 firms and individuals . <EOS> `` Ninety-nine companies and 6 individuals have been added to the list , all related to Iranian nuclear weapon development , '' said Kim Young-min with the finance ministry . <EOS> Last year , South Korea blacklisted 102 organizations and 24 individuals . <EOS> The government also warned South Korean companies that `` they may find disadvantages when doing business with the U.S. if they contribute to the Iranian petroleum industry or petrochemical maintenance expansion , '' Kim said . <EOS> The latest sanctions are part of a U.S.-led , but international effort to tighten the screws around the Iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program . <EOS> Britain has cut all financial ties with Iran , the first time it has cut an entire country 's banking sector off from British finance , the British Treasury announced in November . <EOS> Similarly , Canada has implemented a series of tougher sanctions , prohibiting almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government . <EOS> Russia and China have been reluctant to impose strong sanctions against Iran . <EOS> The moves followed an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighting new concerns about `` the possible military dimensions of Iran 's nuclear program . '' <EOS> Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog 's report `` unbalanced '' and `` politically motivated . ''

-LRB- Mashable -RRB- -- In a refreshingly honest statement , Samsung 's mobile division VP Lee Don-Joo admitted that the iPad 2 made some parts of Samsung 's 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab look `` inadequate , '' and the iPad 2 's pricing might force Samsung to lower the price of its tablet . <EOS> `` Apple made it very thin -LRB- ... -RRB- We will have to improve the parts that are inadequate , '' Lee Don-Joo told Yonhap News Agency . <EOS> We feel that a bit of information might have gotten lost in translation from Korean to English , as we definitely do n't expect Samsung to pull the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab from the market and release a thinner version . <EOS> It 's more likely that Samsung simply sees the iPad 2 's thinness as a big challenge for its future tablet models . <EOS> The other part of Lee Don-Joo 's statement is clearer and far more telling . <EOS> `` The 10-inch -LRB- tablet -RRB- was to be priced higher than the 7-inch , but we will have to think that over , '' he said . <EOS> Samsung , unlike some of its competitors -- for example , the Motorola Xoom -- wo n't try to compete with the iPad at a higher price point just because some of the hardware of its tablet looks better on paper and that , in our opinion , is the right approach . <EOS> Apple has set the price for its tablet in the $ 499 -- $ 829 price range -LRB- with the cheapest 3G-sporting option being priced at $ 629 -RRB- , and any Android tablet will have a hard time competing with the iPad 2 at a price too near the upper end of that spectrum . <EOS> 2013 MASHABLE.com . <EOS> All rights reserved .
On the surface of one of Saturn 's icy moons , scientists have discovered the possible existence of a very important , life-sustaining element : liquid water . <EOS> NASA scientists announced Monday the identification of 101 distinct geysers erupting on Saturn 's moon Enceladus . <EOS> Their analysis suggests that water , a crucial component for life beyond our planet , can reach the Saturnian moon 's surface . <EOS> First sighted in 2005 , the geysers erupt from four `` tiger stripe '' fractures along the moon 's south polar terrain and spew tiny ice particles and water vapor , NASA said in news release . <EOS> After seven years of collecting mission data from NASA 's Cassini spacecraft , scientists found the geysers to be powered by small hot spots -- the result of water vapor condensing and venting from subsurface seawater ; thus , answering questions about the geysers ' origins . <EOS> Researchers had previously thought the ice particles and water vapor came from either frictional heat or from water vapor below the surface . <EOS> `` Once we had these results in hand , we knew right away heat was not causing the geysers , but vice versa , '' said NASA adviser Carolyn Porco , who led the Cassini imaging team . <EOS> `` It also told us the geysers are not a near-surface phenomenon , but have much deeper roots .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fueled by hot , dry conditions , a wildfire near Flagstaff in northern Arizona grew to 10,000 acres , city officials said late Monday . <EOS> The blaze spread so quickly , it caught some locals off guard . <EOS> Flagstaff city spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said the source of the fire was an abandoned campfire . <EOS> The Schultz Fire ignited late Sunday morning , shutting down part of U.S. Route 89 and causing the Coconino County Sheriff 's Office to evacuate at least 748 properties , including two residential neighborhoods , an animal shelter and the Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monuments . <EOS> The sheriff 's office is recommending that nearby residents put together evacuation kits . <EOS> `` It 's something that unless you 've lived through it , I do n't think you can imagine , '' evacuee Patti Vorhees told CNN affiliate KTVK as she packed up her pets and left . <EOS> `` You literally take your prescriptions , your animals and the clothes on your back . '' <EOS> The Red Cross has set up a shelter at Mount Elden Middle School in Flagstaff . <EOS> The Coconino County website says the U.S. Forest Service and several fire departments responded with about 300 firefighters , eight air tankers and five helicopters to put out the blaze . <EOS> A Type One Incident Management Team also was sent to the scene . <EOS> The U.S. Fire Administration website says that 's a self-contained team of 35 to 50 highly trained personnel deployed to manage incidents of `` national significance . '' <EOS> High winds in the area Sunday did n't help . <EOS> The winds both stoked the flames and caused emergency crews to ground the air tankers for 5 1/2 hours Sunday afternoon . <EOS> CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said gusty southwesterly winds , from 20 to 30 mph , will blow through the area through Tuesday , then calm by Wednesday morning . <EOS> There 's a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the area beginning on Thursday , Morris said . <EOS> Government fire spokesman Eric Neitzel told CNN affiliate KPHO that higher humidity and lower temperatures overnight allowed firefighters to `` make some good progress on the line '' and protect structures . <EOS> KTVK 's website , www.azfamily.com , says authorities shut down part of Highway 89 Sunday because of visibility issues , as the Schultz Fire was producing a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles . <EOS> But by Monday morning , Neitzel told KPHO the cooperative overnight weather , including calmer winds , were making the smoke '' -LSB- lay -RSB- down ... so you do n't see the big tower of smoke .

Cuban authorities detained dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez along with two others as she traveled to cover the trial of a Spanish politician accused of killing a prominent dissident , a human rights activist told CNN on Friday . <EOS> A family member of the well-known blogger said that Sanchez , her husband , Reinaldo Escobar , and another blogger , Agustin Diaz , were arrested in the eastern Cuban city of Bayamo on Thursday , activist and dissident Elizardo Sanchez told CNN en Espaol . <EOS> Yoani Sanchez and her two companions were destined for Bayamo , where the trial of Spanish politician Angel Carromero was scheduled to begin Friday . <EOS> She was covering the trial for Spain 's leading newspaper , El Pais , which also reported on its website that she had been detained . <EOS> Spanish politician charged in dissident 's death But Sanchez never arrived at her destination , and her cell phone was disconnected , Elizardo Sanchez said . <EOS> CNN has not independently confirmed the arrests . <EOS> Cuban officials declined to comment on reports of her arrest . <EOS> A pro-government blogger known as Yohandry Fontana , who is considered a counterbalance to Yoani Sanchez , said that Sanchez intended to put on a `` media show '' in Bayamo and disrupt Carromero 's trial . <EOS> The U.S. State Department called the arrest the `` latest crackdown '' on journalists . <EOS> `` We are deeply disturbed by the Cuban government 's repeated use of arbitrary detention to silence critics , disrupt peaceful assembly , and impede independent journalism , '' State Department spokesman William Ostick said . <EOS> Carromero is facing a vehicular homicide charge for a car crash that killed prominent Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya . <EOS> He could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty . <EOS> He is accused of speeding and then losing control of a car that he , Paya , Swedish politician Jans Aron Modig and Cuban dissident Harold Cepero were traveling in . <EOS> Paya and Cepero were killed when the car struck a tree near Las Gavinas , Cuba , in July . <EOS> After Paya 's death , his family immediately accused Cuban authorities of foul play and said they had received information that another vehicle had forced the car Paya was in off the road . <EOS> The Cuban government has denied any involvement in Paya 's death . <EOS> El Pais said that it had lost contact with Yoani Sanchez and that a Cuban photographer , Orlando Luis Pardo , said he had spoken with her son , who had received a call from her confirming her detention . <EOS> Sanchez gained international attention for her blog `` Generation Y , '' which gets about 1 million hits a month . <EOS> Freedom of speech is limited on the communist island nation , whose media is controlled by the government . <EOS> `` The arrest of these journalists clearly indicates that the Cuban government continues its practice of punishing independent reporting , '' said Carlos Lauria , senior Americas program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists . <EOS> `` Cuban authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Sanchez , Escobar and Daz and allow all Cuban reporters to report without fear of intimidation . '' <EOS> In 2008 , Time magazine named Sanchez one of the world 's 100 most influential people .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in the failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. airliner faces a six-count federal indictment issued Wednesday , including an attempt to murder the other 289 people aboard . <EOS> The seven-page indictment charges Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction ; attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; willful attempt to destroy and wreck an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; willfully placing a destructive device in , upon and in proximity to an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; and two counts of possession of a firearm/destructive in furtherance of a crime of violence . <EOS> Read the indictment If convicted , the 23-year-old Nigerian national faces a sentence of life in prison . <EOS> The indictment said AbdulMutallab boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam , Netherlands , on December 25 , carrying a concealed bomb concealed in his clothing and designed to be detonated `` at a time of his choosing . '' <EOS> Authorities say the bomb components included Pentaerythritol -LRB- also known as PETN , a high explosive -RRB- , as well as Triacetone Triperoxide -LRB- also known as TATP , a high explosive -RRB- and other ingredients . <EOS> The indictment said that , just before the jet landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan , `` AbdulMutallab detonated the bomb , causing a fire on board flight 253 . '' <EOS> The device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at the man 's seat . <EOS> He was subdued and restrained by the passengers and flight crew . <EOS> The airplane landed shortly thereafter , and he was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers . <EOS> AbdulMutallab required medical treatment and was transported to the University of Michigan Medical Center after the plane landed . <EOS> Explosives expert Sydney Alford said AbdulMutallab probably used a liquid contained in a syringe to mix with a chemical he was carrying to create a fire , which was intended to ignite the TATP . <EOS> That , in turn , was to detonate the PETN . <EOS> But the TATP did not ignite as planned , he speculated . <EOS> TATP has been cited in several terrorism cases . <EOS> Najibullah Zazi , the 24-year-old Afghan citizen and U.S. resident who was arrested in September and accused of planning to carry out terrorist acts in the United States , was allegedly trying to make TATP in his motel room in Denver , Colorado . <EOS> A new indictment against Richard Reid specifies that the convicted shoe bomber also used TATP . <EOS> Judge Nancy Edmunds is assigned to the AbdulMutallab case and will preside over court proceedings , said Gina Balaya , spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney , Eastern District , Michigan . <EOS> The case was presented Wednesday to the grand jury , which determined probable cause to indict . <EOS> Though arraignments are typically held by a magistrate judge , Edmunds may decide , based on the special circumstances and high-profile security related to the AbdulMutallab case , to handle the matter herself , Balaya said . <EOS> Edmunds is expected to decide Friday on details for the arraignment and AbdulMutallab 's detention , Balaya said . <EOS> Attorney General Eric Holder said the investigation `` has already yielded valuable intelligence that we will follow wherever it leads . '' <EOS> `` The attempted murder of 289 innocent people merits the most serious charges available , and that 's what we have charged in this indictment , '' said U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade , U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan , who is in her first week on the job .
Call it part tank , part boat and part beer cooler . <EOS> But it 's unquestionably all cool . <EOS> It 's a new U.S. Marine Corps vehicle for getting stuff like troops , tanks and trucks from ships to shore and back . <EOS> The Corps showed off a prototype of its Ultra Heavy-lift Amphibious Connector -LRB- UHAC -RRB- last week during Rim of the Pacific exercises in Hawaii , running it from the Navy 's amphibious dock landing ship USS Rushmore to the beaches of Marine Corps Training Area Bellows on Oahu . <EOS> `` Showcasing the UHAC during RIMPAC is a big deal , '' Dave George of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab , which developed the UHAC with funding from the Office of Naval Research , said in a press release . <EOS> `` This is a great way to let people know that this new technology is being developed . '' <EOS> Here 's how the UHAC works : The tracks , which are made of what the Marines call `` captured-air foam blocks , '' extend like flippers to propel the craft through the water . <EOS> When it hits the beach , the foam flattens to become like the tracks on a tank or a bulldozer , only much softer , according to a report from Stars and Stripes . <EOS> Last week , the UHAC prototype , which is about half the size of envisioned production models , carried an assault vehicle from the Rushmore to the beach . <EOS> The Marine Corps says a full-size UHAC would be able to carry much more . <EOS> `` The full-scale model should be able to carry at least three tanks and a HMMVW -LRB- High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle -RRB- , '' Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Perera , the Warfighting Lab 's Infantry Weapons Project officer , said in a statement . <EOS> That 's about three times the load that the Corps ' current craft assigned to the task , called a Landing Craft Air Cushion -LRB- LCAC -RRB- , can handle . <EOS> It also will be able to surmount bigger obstacles . <EOS> While an LCAC can only get over a 4-foot-high sea wall , a full-size UHAC will be able to get over sea walls as high as 10 , 12 or even 16 feet , according to the Corps . <EOS> The UHAC prototype type is not armored or armed , but Perera said production models would have armor plating and a .50 - caliber machine guns for protection . <EOS> They also would be much faster . <EOS> The prototype could only go 5 mph on the water , but a full-size UHAC should do 25 mph , Gen. Kevin Killea , commander of the Corps ' Warfighting Lab , told Stars and Stripes . <EOS> The UHAC prototype used last week is the third in the program , built upon a concept originally proposed by the Hawaii-based shipbuilding and research firm Navatek , Ltd. `` There has been a one-fifth scale model , then a one-quarter scale model and this is a half-scale model , so we have been progressing , '' Frank Leban , program officer at the Office of Naval Research , said in a statement . <EOS> `` Every vehicle has incorporated more features and technology to help get us to the full scale . '' <EOS> There 's no word yet on when the full-scale model may actually come , but officials were happy with last week 's demonstration . <EOS> `` This is a great way to show what it can do , '' said George . <EOS> `` Today went quite well . ''
The Pennsylvania woman who resurfaced last month after being missing for 11 years has been sentenced to nearly a year in a Florida county jail , a court clerk said Wednesday . <EOS> Brenda Heist , 54 , was ordered to serve 364 days for violating probation , said Lisa Ates , senior court clerk for the Santa Rosa County Circuit Court in Florida . <EOS> Heist had been reported missing in Pennsylvania in 2002 . <EOS> On February 15 , before she admitted she was the missing woman , Heist was arrested in Florida for falsely using the driver 's license of a woman for whom she had previously worked as a cleaning lady , according to police documents . <EOS> Heist was living under the name Kelsie Smith . <EOS> Daughter to mom : Rot in hell Heist had been sentenced to three years of probation for the identity theft and for giving false information to a law enforcement officer . <EOS> After release from jail in April , she failed to report to authorities and a warrant was put out for her arrest , police records say . <EOS> Heist turned herself in to authorities in Key Largo , Florida , in May , informing them that she thought she might be wanted in another county . <EOS> Friends tell different story of woman who reappeared The responding officer checked her name and saw that she was listed as `` missing and possibly deceased '' from Lititz , Pennsylvania , according to the Monroe County Sheriff 's Office in Florida . <EOS> Authorities in Florida then contacted Lititz Borough police , who confirmed her identity as a woman who had gone missing in 2002 . <EOS> Heist last had been seen dropping off her children at school in Pennsylvania more than a decade ago . <EOS> She was going through a divorce at the time and was struggling financially . <EOS> After being approached by a two males and one female who saw her crying in a park , she decided , on a whim , to hitchhike down to Florida with them , said Detective John Schofield of the Lititz Borough Police Department . <EOS> Opinion : Why there are more walk-away moms She told police she was homeless for the first two years , living under bridges and eating food thrown out by restaurants after they closed . <EOS> For the following seven years , she lived in a camper with a man she had met , she said . <EOS> They made money as day laborers , cleaning boats and doing other odd jobs for which they did n't have to show identification and were paid in cash . <EOS> After that relationship soured , Schofield said , she lived on the street again for another two years . <EOS> `` Everything seemed to be going against her while she was on the street , '' Schofield said . <EOS> `` She was just worn out and at the end of her rope . <EOS> She did n't want to continue on with her secret life down there .

Additional U.S. military advisers are now on the ground in northern Iraq with the Obama administration considering a possible air evacuation of thousands of minority Yazidis under threat from Islamic State militants and trapped on Mount Sinjar . <EOS> President Barack Obama ordered nearly 130 advisers to Irbil to assess the situation , and it 's now likely that a small number of them will travel to the mountain area to get a first-hand look at what might be possible . <EOS> The new group comprised of Marines and special forces adds to the hundreds of other American advisers already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against Sunni militants from the Islamic State , an al Qaeda off-shoot formally known as ISIS . <EOS> The group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in Iraq . <EOS> It 's aiming to establish a caliphate . <EOS> Hundreds of thousands of Iraq 's ethnic and religious minorities have fled ISIS fighters . <EOS> Nowhere is the crisis more evident than the Sinjar Mountains , where an estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis are hiding . <EOS> The plight of the Yazidis , coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq 's semiautonomous Kurdish region , prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days . <EOS> The aim , according to Obama , is to help protect U.S. personnel in the area and to destroy ISIS positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups . <EOS> Air evacuation option Obama has also authorized humanitarian airdrops to help the Yazidis , and is now weighing an air evacuation , a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday . <EOS> Focusing on a possible air option -- rather than a ground one -- is due to initial indications that going by land would take too long would up the risk to the Yazidis , according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked not to be named . <EOS> In addition , many of the stranded Yazidis are in poor medical condition to make a lengthy journey , the official said . <EOS> However , American officials did say that a ground option is still under consideration as well . <EOS> If an air operation is proposed and approved by Obama , it would require putting U.S. ground troops both on the mountain and at a nearby airfield , the official said . <EOS> The operation will be characterized as a short-term humanitarian mission , not a combat one . <EOS> But U.S. troops would have the right to defend themselves against any ISIS attacks . <EOS> As part of an air evacuation , American forces would establish a security corridor around the area to try to provide airspace for helicopters and other aircraft to pick up people . <EOS> The newly arrived advisers would form the beginning of a joint task force to carry out such an operation , the official said . <EOS> They would work to develop procedures for rescuing and then processing people taken off the mountain . <EOS> But there are still several unresolved questions -- such as , where will the Yazidis be flown to ? <EOS> Asked about a potential evacuation operation on CNN 's `` New Day , '' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said he did n't `` want to get too far out in front '' of any potential scenarios . <EOS> `` We should n't be jumping to a conclusion right now that there is or wo n't be a rescue operation in particular , '' he said .
Scientists have picked a prime landing site on the `` head '' of a comet for the next stage of the Rosetta mission . <EOS> The project , led by the European Space Agency -LRB- ESA -RRB- with partners including NASA , recently placed the Rosetta probe in an orbit 30km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- from the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a 10-year chase across the solar system . <EOS> If successful , the mission will be the first to orbit and land on a comet as it journeys around the Sun . <EOS> A statement on the space agency 's Rosetta blog says landing site `` J '' was chosen due to its `` scientific potential '' while posing less risk to Rosetta 's lander module Philae compared to other possible sites . <EOS> A backup site -LRB- marked `` C '' in the above composite image -RRB- has been identified on the irregularly-shaped `` body '' of the comet which has two distinct lobes -- and mission controllers say they are aiming to reach the surface on November 11 . <EOS> Rosetta will stay in orbit around the comet as it rushes towards the Sun , taking measurements as gas and dust are ejected into a huge tail , while the lander carries out experiments on the surface . <EOS> The mission is aimed at learning more about the composition of comets and the project may shed light on whether they brought water to Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life . <EOS> 3D animation : See how Rosetta met the comet `` We will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site , giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition , structure and evolution of a comet , '' said a lead lander scientist Jean-Pierre Bibring on ESA 's Rosetta website . <EOS> Making a landing is particularly difficult as the probes are so far away that steering Philae once it has separated from Rosetta is not possible . <EOS> The lander 's trajectory has to be programmed ahead of its release . <EOS> Project leaders had to find a landing site that avoids large surface hazards and allows Philae to continue to communicate with Rosetta . <EOS> Before the prime landing site was chosen , Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor also explained that power was a crucial consideration . <EOS> Philae 's batteries will have enough charge for 64 hours but the lander needs sunlight to generate more energy for the extended science mission . <EOS> `` There are certain parts of the comet where you wo n't be able to do any science because you will never get the lander in enough sunlight to be able to recharge the batteries , '' Taylor told CNN . <EOS> Taylor shared the excitement of seeing the first high-resolution close-up images but said his reaction to the odd shape was : `` What are we going to do with this ? <EOS> Where are we going to go ? <EOS> `` It has presented a challenge as to where we can land on the comet because there are certain regions you just ca n't reach . <EOS> The neck is quite difficult to get to -- it 's difficult to get a trajectory that will end up on that point without clipping one of the lobes . '' <EOS> Taylor told CNN that results were starting to come in from the on-board instruments . <EOS> `` There are some dust instruments that kind of put their hand up for a couple of weeks and then bring the hand back in again and analyze what it 's caught , '' he said . <EOS> `` We are starting to sniff and taste the comet . '' <EOS> You can follow Rosetta 's mission on Twitter @ESA_Rosetta and through the ESA blog .
Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She ate her favorite food all day long and rarely exercised . <EOS> She had a few brief failed relationships but mostly stayed single and never gave birth . <EOS> Defying conventional wisdom on a healthy lifestyle , she somehow found the secret to longevity . <EOS> When she died of kidney failure on May 7 in southern China , some local media called Ming Ming , 34 , the world 's oldest giant panda , generating global headlines . <EOS> Wild pandas live 15 years on average , while those in captivity can live much longer thanks to improved nutrition and medical care , according to WWF , the nature conservation organization whose logo famously features a giant panda . <EOS> CNN anchor 's surprising views on pandas At least two pandas had lived longer than Ming Ming , state media has reported . <EOS> Tao Tao died in 2008 at the age of 36 and Chang Chang passed away in 2002 at the age of 35 . <EOS> `` The longevity of those pandas does n't have too much to do with our conservation effort , '' said Professor Fan Zhiyong , head of the species program at WWF 's Beijing office . <EOS> `` In captivity pandas do n't have to worry about food sources , infectious diseases and competition from other species -- all of which remain challenges to their survival in the wild . '' <EOS> While both Tao Tao and Chang Chang spent most of their lives in a zoo in eastern China , Ming Ming 's life journey spanned half the globe . <EOS> Her longevity had surpassed most people 's expectations . <EOS> She was rescued in 1979 in the mountains of Sichuan province , a rare sanctuary for one of the world 's most endangered species . <EOS> Some 300 pandas live in captivity in China , mostly in breeding programs aimed at boosting the low population caused by disappearing natural habitats and low fertility rate . <EOS> Fewer than a dozen zoos outside China have pandas . <EOS> `` Ming Ming had always been weak ever since she was rescued , '' said Huang Zhi , one of her caretakers at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong , also in Sichuan , where she grew up . <EOS> `` She was quite timid and not very close to people , '' he added . <EOS> Despite the personality , Ming Ming played the panda ambassador when the Chinese government dispatched her to the London Zoo in 1991 . <EOS> Fighting instead of mating with a male panda from Berlin , Ming Ming failed her most important duty and returned home three years later . <EOS> She moved one last time in 1998 to a safari park in the southern Guangdong province , where old age eventually caused multiple health problems . <EOS> Huang , Ming Ming 's longtime caretaker , last visited her in April . <EOS> `` Her eyesight was deteriorating -- and she moved very slowly and ate very little , '' he recalled . <EOS> `` I felt she was very old .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Back in 2007 , when I was participating at a conference on U.S.-China relations , the late U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke repeatedly came back to the importance of not writing the United States off , while warning against getting overexcited about the new emerging China imperium . <EOS> `` The U.S. , '' he said , `` is not going away any time soon . '' <EOS> Holbrooke 's views are evidently shared by the current leadership of China . <EOS> While many commentators excitedly jabber about the end of the U.S. era and comment on how President Barack Obama -- diminished by his recent electoral drubbing at home -- is regarded as weak and irrelevant in Beijing , the people that matter , namely the Chinese leadership , have proved shrewd enough not to buy into this sort of talk . <EOS> They see through the transient nature of presidents and their power , and as a strategic political and economic partner , understand that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right : For them , the United States is the one indispensable nation . <EOS> The proof of this is the comprehensive agreements issued this year during the APEC meeting in Beijing . <EOS> Forget all the theater of Russian President Vladimir Putin scowling at Obama minutes before trying to engulf the Chinese President 's glamorous wife in a shawl , or the icy image of Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's hand . <EOS> Because the reality is that -- despite the narrative we might like to impose on all this of a world beating its tracks to Beijing 's door -- for policymakers in Beijing , deals like the one just made with the United States on slashing carbon emissions , or the ones on security and economic cooperation , are the one currency truly worth having . <EOS> But the most misleading aspect of U.S.-China relations is that while in public they are frequently conducted in snarling rhetoric , underneath both sides probably have more mutual links and increasing common ground than ever before . <EOS> And while separating the sound and fury from the truth is tough , on the fight against terrorism , the need to find sustainable economic growth , preserving a benign , stable international environment , and increasing predictability in the global financial governance system , China and the United States often pretend they are much further apart than they actually are . <EOS> Their main business now is tactical -- trying to search out spaces for strategic advantage . <EOS> With its proposed Asian Free Trade Zone , along with building diverse energy supply links through Russia and central Asia , China is engaged in staking out discrete spaces where it can move without being hedged in . <EOS> It knows that long arguments with neighbors like Japan peg it down and reduce its space to act . <EOS> Having as many friends as possible is Xi 's diplomatic priority , after years of brittle tensions with so many countries around China 's land and maritime borders . <EOS> There is a simple reason for this . <EOS> China is entering a period of tough economic transition . <EOS> The Third and Fourth Plenum meetings of the Chinese Communist Party made this clear . <EOS> Many things need to be done , from raising consumption to addressing water supply issues and the dangerous state of the air quality in the country . <EOS> Too many rows with the world outside distract from the real business of dealing with these internal matters . <EOS> And in all these areas , whatever the distrust and misunderstandings held by the world 's second biggest economy toward the largest , the gains from continuing to be constructive and mostly friendly , at least on the surface , far outweigh the benefits of acting tough . <EOS> Of course , all this might change one day , when China really feels it has to demand more international strategic space and sees the United States as an impediment to that . <EOS> But APEC this year has underscored that that day is a long time in the future .

'' <EOS> Sporadic fighting that began earlier Thursday stretched over several hours in the southeastern sector of Garmser district , said Pelletier , spokesman for the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan . <EOS> Helmand province , a poppy-growing region , is the focus of the U.S.-led Operation Khanjar . <EOS> Afghanistan supplies 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used in the production of heroin . <EOS> The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of Afghan national elections in August . <EOS> Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors from the expeditionary brigade , along with more than 600 Afghan national security forces , are operating in key population centers along the valley , Pelletier said . <EOS> Their targets are Garmser and Nawa districts in central Helmand , and stretch to Rig district in the south , Pelletier said . <EOS> Marines and Afghan forces have taken over the key town of Khan Neshin , the capital of Rig district , which had been under Taliban control , the Marine source said . <EOS> The goal is to protect residents from the threat of Taliban and other insurgent intimidation and violence , Pelletier said . <EOS> `` Our focus is now and will remain the Afghan people . <EOS> We have worked closely with local Helmand government officials and many tribal and local leaders in the detailed planning of this major offensive , '' said Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson , commander of Task Force Leatherneck . <EOS> Once security is established , civil affairs personnel and other nongovernmental groups and agencies can come in and establish programs . <EOS> However , Taliban control of the countryside is so extensive in provinces such as Helmand and Kandahar to the east that security forces face a tough job , according to a report this week in The New York Times . <EOS> The government has no involvement in five of Helmand 's 13 districts , the report said . <EOS> In the fighting that began Thursday , Marines fired 20 mm cannons from their Cobra helicopter gunships -- but dropped no bombs -- to avoid the higher risk of civilian casualties , the Marine source said . <EOS> The source called resistance `` heavy '' and `` persistent '' but intermittent . <EOS> Militants responded using small arms , rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns . <EOS> `` Last night , Marines bedded down in compounds within cities ... with permission from the people '' rather than sleep in a restricted area away from the local population , Pelletier said . <EOS> He said military leaders also were holding talks with village leaders . <EOS> In other developments CNN 's Atia Abawi , Barbara Starr and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report .

'' <EOS> A troublesome year The announcement is one of the few celebratory moments for the company in recent months . <EOS> The four-month global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet after an ANA flight was diverted following a battery fire in January was the first such global grounding in 30 years . <EOS> The grounding was lifted at the end of April . <EOS> Since the dramatic ANA incident , Dreamliner 's list of problems have gone on to include a United Airlines emergency landing in Houston due to brake problems , a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport and plane groundings and investigations into a faulty fuel pump indicator , an electric panel , a plane oven and emergency beacons . <EOS> As well as being lighter and more fuel efficient than other similar aircraft , the Dreamliner 's in-cabin experience is different too . <EOS> It has bigger , dimmable windows -LRB- out go the pull-down shutters -RRB- , it has LED mood lighting and is pressurized at 6,000 feet rather than 8,000 feet , making air sickness less likely . <EOS> `` We are working with our supplier partners to continue to introduce improvements to the 787-8 to enhance reliability , just as we do for all of our airplane models , '' said Boeing 's communications representative Julie O'Donnell . <EOS> `` As the 787-8 and 787-9 share a high degree of commonality , we will apply relevant improvements to the 787-9 as appropriate .

The father of a 21-year-old foreign exchange student nabbed by anti-terrorism teams in New York over an alleged plot to blow up Manhattan 's Federal Reserve Bank says his son is a timid man who was often scared to travel alone and that he simply does n't believe the terror accusations . <EOS> `` I do n't believe my son has any link to any terror groups , '' said Quazi Mohammad Ahsanullah , a banker in Dhaka . <EOS> `` I urge the government of Bangladesh to bring back my son . '' <EOS> He said he learned of his son 's capture after a relative phoned him Thursday and told him to turn on the news on television . <EOS> `` We 're really stunned , '' he said . <EOS> `` We could n't believe our eyes . <EOS> ... We could n't believe our ears . <EOS> It came to us out of the blue . '' <EOS> Terror plotting : Bravado or sincerity Federal authorities in New York arrested Quazi Mohammad Rezwanual Ahsan Nafis on Wednesday after they say he tried to detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb , using his cell phone as a trigger . <EOS> Inspired by al Qaeda , they say , Nafis now faces a slew of terror charges with evidence largely derived from an undercover agent that the Bangladeshi national allegedly contacted to help further his plot . <EOS> But Ahsanullah instead described his son as a shy young man who left college in Missouri after one semester because of the expense and took a job in New York , working 10-hour days at a hotel . <EOS> During his short time at the school , Southeast Missouri State University , Nafis was elected an officer of the Muslim Student Association , a school official said . <EOS> `` He was elected vice president at the very end of the spring semester . <EOS> But since he left our university shortly thereafter , his tenure as an officer was very short-lived , '' Ann Hayes said . <EOS> Bangladesh police on Thursday started investigating whether Nafis had any terror link , police said . <EOS> `` We 're not officially informed by the United States about the alleged plot and the subsequent detention , but we 're looking into if Nafis had any terror link before leaving Dhaka , '' Monirul Islam , chief of the detective police in Dhaka , told CNN . <EOS> The detective police in Dhaka picked up the parents and some other relatives of Nafis from their Jatrabari residence and questioned them about his past activities on Thursday evening local time . <EOS> `` We have n't arrested anyone ... we 've brought them to know some information regarding Nafis , '' Islam said adding , `` We 've just started the investigation , and we 're yet to find any terror link of Nafis ... but we 'll continue the investigation and interrogate more people who know Nafis . <EOS> It may be his friends , teachers , neighbors and others . '' <EOS> Nafis graduated high school in 2006 and got his higher secondary school certificate examinations in 2008 before he enrolled with the country 's leading private university , North South University , in Dhaka . <EOS> As the authorities in New York alleged that Nafis traveled to the United States with `` the purpose of conducting a terrorist attack '' and actively sought out al Qaeda contacts after his arrival , his father claimed that he had allowed him to go to the United States for a better future . <EOS> `` I ca n't believe this because as a father I found him very timid ... sometimes he was even scared of traveling alone , '' Ahsanullah said .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barcelona 's faltering defense of the La Liga title plumbed a fresh low Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at relegation strugglers Valladolid -- the third in the last seven league games . <EOS> No matter that Barca enjoyed 80 per cent of the possession , the only statistic that mattered was a 17th minute strike from Italian Fausto Rossi . <EOS> Arch-rivals Real Madrid can move four points clear of Barca with a home victory over Levante Sunday . <EOS> But it was Real 's city neighbors Atletico who topped the standings Saturday night as a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo saw them leapfrog both the ` big two ' in Spain . <EOS> David Villa scored twice to help them draw level with Real on 64 points , with a better head to head record , but having played a game more . <EOS> Barcelona will be ruing the missed opportunity to keep the pressure on leaders Real , despite boss Gerardo Martino fielding a strong team after the international break . <EOS> Lionel Messi was kept off the score sheet by excellent saves from home keeper Diego Marino and he was forced into action by the Argentina ace before the only goal of the match . <EOS> Rossi fired home from close range past Victor Valdes after indecision in the Barcelona defense . <EOS> Messi had to more efforts saved by halftime but after the break it was Neymar who missed Barca 's best chance , blazing over from close range after being set up by Cesc Fabregas . <EOS> The home side held out comfortably enough and might have added to their tally when Oscar spurned a fine chance . <EOS> But they were left to celebrate a famous victory to move out of the relegation zone . <EOS> `` We lacked ideas , movement and penetration , but I did n't in any way see a lack of attitude , '' Martino told AFP after the defeat . <EOS> His side will have to regroup ahead of the visit of Manchester City Wednesday in the Champions League , but lead 2-0 from the first leg in the last 16 tie . <EOS> The Catalan giants suffered a stinging 6-0 aggregate defeat to eventual winners Bayern Munich in the semifinals of last year 's competition but had been in impeccable form under Martino until recent domestic setbacks . <EOS> Meanwhile free-scoring Bayern have continued their all-conquering form , thrashing fifth-placed Wolfsburg 6-1 in the Bundesliga Saturday , despite the match being tied 1-1 at halftime . <EOS> Bayern even trailed to a goal from Wolfsburg defender Naldo before Xherdan Shaqiri equalized by the break . <EOS> Five goals in just 17 minutes continued the incredible scoring feats of the Bavarian giants with Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic each getting a double . <EOS> Franck Ribery added the other for the defending German champions , who stretched their unbeaten league run to a record 49 matches . <EOS> In 24 league matches , Pep Guardiola 's team have registered an impressive 72 goals to leave them 23 points clear of nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund , who play Sunday . <EOS> In France 's Ligue 1 , Paris Saint Germain took another big step towards retaining the title with a 3-0 win at Bastia . <EOS> Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the opener and set up Ezequiel Lavezzi for the other two goals , the first assist from a impudent back-flick . <EOS> The win left PSG eight points clear of title rivals Monaco , who beat Sochaux 2-1 in a later game .

'' <EOS> His remains were found not far from where Miller 's truck was located in Petrolia , California , last year , said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko . <EOS> It was not immediately clear how long they had been there . <EOS> The remains were reported Friday on the banks of the Mattole River , according to a statement from the Sheriff 's Office , and were identified through dental records . <EOS> Miller was featured in Episode 1 of `` The Hunt . '' <EOS> Authorities had been looking for him since May 2013 . <EOS> On May 7 , 2013 , a 911 dispatcher got a call from the Miller residence . <EOS> The sounds of breathing and crying , then loud bangs , could be heard before the line went dead . <EOS> When police arrived at the home , they found the bodies of Miller 's wife , Sandy Miller , and the couple 's two daughters -- Shelby , 8 , and Shasta , 5 -- with multiple gunshot wounds . <EOS> Shane Miller quickly became the lead suspect in the case . <EOS> After the killings , he , his truck and the family dog went missing . <EOS> Miller was later spotted by an ex-girlfriend in Petrolia , sparking the manhunt . <EOS> He ditched his truck and authorities had thought he fled on foot into the mountainous forests of California 's `` Lost Coast . '' <EOS> His remains were found about 1,500 feet from Miller 's vehicle , the Sheriff 's Office said . <EOS> Near them , authorities recovered a handgun and loaded magazines . <EOS> The ammunition in the magazines was consistent with ammunition found in Miller 's truck , and at the family 's slaying scene , the Sheriff 's Office said . <EOS> `` The Hunt , '' which premiered on CNN on July 13 , aims to expose stories of ongoing criminal investigations of fugitives and expand the search internationally . <EOS> Last week , a 32-year-old suspected sex offender featured on the show died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in . <EOS> Investigators said they sifted through hundreds of tips in their search for that suspect , Charles Mozdir , but a phone call they got during `` The Hunt '' helped them crack the case . <EOS> `` It 's been quite a week , and I think lots of people are relieved that both of these guys are off the streets , '' Walsh said Sunday . <EOS> Join `` The Hunt '' for more fugitives
A former Kaufman County , Texas , justice of the peace -- whose home , one day ago , was searched by authorities investigating the deaths of two Texas prosecutors -- is under arrest , law officers said Saturday . <EOS> Eric Williams was arrested by sheriff 's office members in Kaufman County and charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a `` terroristic threat .

'' <EOS> Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS earlier this month that he understands why authorities wanted to meet with him . <EOS> `` If I was in their shoes , I would want to talk to me , '' he said . <EOS> `` In the investigators ' minds , they want to check with me to do their process of elimination . '' <EOS> Williams said he has no ill will toward prosecutors -- he said he believes they were `` doing their jobs '' -- and has cooperated with law enforcement . <EOS> `` I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act , '' he said .
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was robbed last week by an intruder armed with a machete while Breyer was vacationing on the Caribbean island of Nevis , court officials said Monday . <EOS> Breyer , his wife and two other guests were in the justice 's vacation home at the time , but officials said no one was hurt in the incident . <EOS> The male assailant took $ 1,000 in cash and fled the scene , according to court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg . <EOS> The robbery was reported to local authorities shortly after it happened last Thursday night , and local media said no arrests had been made as of Monday . <EOS> A law enforcement official said the evidence so far indicates the incident was `` a crime of opportunity , '' and that police have seen nothing so far to indicate Breyer was targeted for robbery . <EOS> The U.S. Marshals Service provides protection for members of the high court when they are traveling , and agency spokesman Jeff Carter said Monday that the marshals service `` is aware of the incident involving Justice Breyer on the Caribbean island of Nevis and is assisting the Supreme Court Police and local law enforcement authorities with the investigation as needed . '' <EOS> He did not elaborate . <EOS> FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said , `` We are assisting the local police with their investigation . '' <EOS> Meanwhile , police on the island were `` actively searching for a known person of interest , '' Commissioner C.G. Walwyn of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force said Monday . <EOS> `` Our American-trained crime scene investigators and the members of our Criminal Investigators -LRB- unit -RRB- are working closely with the FBI on this case , '' he added . <EOS> Breyer had no comment on the matter , and the court would not say if he had returned to the United States . <EOS> The high court is in recess this week , but the justices have scheduled a closed-door meeting Friday to go over pending court business , and they resume public sessions next week . <EOS> Nevis is part of the West Indies chain known as the Leeward Islands , located about 350 miles southeast of Puerto Rico . <EOS> The court does not talk publicly about specific security arrangements for the justices , either when they are at home or on their frequent travels . <EOS> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg traveled to Egypt and Tunisia last month as part of an outreach program sponsored by the State Department , which provided her security in the volatile region . <EOS> Attacks on members of the federal judiciary are not new . <EOS> Then-Justice David Souter was assaulted by a group of young males in 2004 while jogging alone in the evening near his Washington home . <EOS> Souter suffered some minor bruises and was briefly treated then released from a local hospital . <EOS> Justice Byron White was attacked in July 1982 while giving a speech in Utah . <EOS> That incident led to regular protection by U.S. marshals for members of the court when they travel . <EOS> The 73-year-old Breyer was nominated to the high court in 1994 , and is known as one of the most active and engaging members of the court . <EOS> His wife is Dr. Joanna Breyer , a renowned pediatric psychologist .
A Montana woman pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges Friday , three months after she allegedly pushed her newlywed husband off a cliff as they hiked through a national park . <EOS> Jordan Linn Graham was arraigned Friday in a U.S. District Court in Missoula , Montana , about 130 miles south of where her newlywed husband Cody Johnson fell to his death on July 7 . <EOS> A federal grand jury on Thursday charged Graham with first - and second-degree murder and making false statements . <EOS> On Friday , she was read those charges but waived a reading of the indictment , according to a court document . <EOS> She subsequently pleaded not guilty on all three counts , was released as she had been before , and her next court appearance was set for October 15 . <EOS> The entire proceeding took about four minutes . <EOS> A call placed by CNN to the federal public defender 's office representing Graham was not immediately returned Friday afternoon , though her attorney has previously said the groom 's death was an accident . <EOS> Johnson and Graham had been married for a little more than a week when Cody Johnson died on a hiking trail in Glacier National Park . <EOS> An affidavit supporting the charges against Graham states that she told police she decided to travel with Johnson to the hiking trail the evening of July 7 and an argument ensued . <EOS> `` Graham stated their argument intensified . <EOS> At one point in time during their arguing , Graham turned and began to walk away . <EOS> She stated Johnson grabbed her by the arm , '' reads the affidavit . <EOS> Graham said she then turned around and removed his hand . <EOS> `` Graham stated she could have just walked away , but due to her anger , she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result , he fell face first off the cliff , '' according to the affidavit . <EOS> Michael Donahoe , Graham 's lawyer , said last month that Johnson pinned his wife down at one point during their argument . <EOS> The final part of their fight -- ending with Johnson falling off the cliff -- was `` all in one motion , the grabbing and pushing , '' according to Donahoe . <EOS> Johnson 's body was found several days later . <EOS> The affidavit also states that Graham texted a friend that same night her husband died , saying in the message that she was going to talk to Johnson about having `` second thoughts .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- ISIS has apparently taken a heavy hit over the past several days . <EOS> The bodies of at least 70 fighters for the terror group have been dropped off over four days at a hospital in the Syrian town of Tal Abyad , a Syrian opposition group told CNN . <EOS> Tal Abyad is on the Turkish border and about 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from Raqqa . <EOS> The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria took control of Raqqa last year . <EOS> ISIS uses the once-liberal city as a kind of headquarters where it applies its hardline interpretation of Islamic law , terrorizing the population . <EOS> Kurdish and Iraqi forces have been battling ISIS on the ground . <EOS> With the help of airstrikes from an international coalition led by the United States , the foot soldiers are now focused on pushing ISIS back from its relentless attempt to take Kobani , a Kurdish town on the Syrian-Turkish border . <EOS> It 's unclear who dropped the bodies of the ISIS fighters off at the hospital , but it was likely other fighters from the militant group , because they control Tal Abyad . <EOS> Sources who work in local medicine confirmed the events to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a group that promotes ending the longstanding regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . <EOS> The group is based in London and first formed when violence broke out in Syria in 2011 , much of it geared toward ousting al-Assad . <EOS> Kobani now is the scene of an unrelenting battle . <EOS> On Sunday , the brief moments of calm were punctuated by sounds of firing from both sides . <EOS> ISIS has shelled the city at least 16 times , sources say , while coalition planes fly low overhead . <EOS> The strategy against ISIS is working , said U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd Austin on Friday . <EOS> He also said that Kobani could fall . <EOS> U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in the city , Central Command said , both times targeting ISIS fighting positions . <EOS> That 's far fewer strikes than days before . <EOS> U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near Kobani on Thursday and Friday , the military reported . <EOS> It will take `` strategic patience '' to beat ISIS , Austin said . <EOS> The U.S. has generally downplayed the importance of Kobani as a key city in the battle against the militants . <EOS> U.S. military : Airstrikes alone wo n't save Kobani However , if ISIS takes Kobani , that would mean it would control land between Raqqa and Turkey -- about 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- . <EOS> CNN 's Raja Razek contributed to this report .
A famous South Korean rock singer is just hours away from swimming into the diplomatic row over a small group of rocky islets in the East Sea , or the Sea of Japan . <EOS> Kim Jang-hoon is among dozens of amateur athletes who left the eastern port of Uljin Monday , bound for Dokdo , a largely uninhabited set of volcanic islands claimed by both South Korea and Japan , known by Tokyo as Takeshima . <EOS> The group 's 55-hour , 230-kilometer relay swim is expected to end Wednesday , on the 67th anniversary of Korea 's independence from Japanese colonial rule . <EOS> Before jumping into the water , singer Kim Jang-Hoon told reporters : `` I will never make such a comment as ` Dokdo is our territory ' when I arrive there . <EOS> It 's meaningless to do so because they are undeniably our territory , '' according to the Yonhap news agency . <EOS> The politically-charged event comes days after Lee Myung-Bak broke with convention to become the first South Korean president to visit the contested islands . <EOS> Read more : What 's behind island dispute ? <EOS> `` Dokdo is indeed our territory and a place worth staking our lives to defend . <EOS> Let 's make sure to safeguard -LRB- the islets -RRB- with pride , '' he was reported to have told police officers stationed on the islands . <EOS> Lee 's visit inflamed Japan which recalled its ambassador to Seoul , Masatoshi Muto , and threatened to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice . <EOS> `` President Lee visited Takeshima , which is an inherent territory of Japan , both in the light of historical facts and based on international law . <EOS> Therefore it is incompatible with the position of Japan , and so I made a strong protest on the matter , '' Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told a press conference Friday . <EOS> Read more : Man crashes Japanese embassy over disputed islands Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory , but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945 . <EOS> According to a South Korean website on the islands , Dokdo has a population of three and amid the craggy rocks sit a lighthouse , lodge , helicopter landing pad , and a police station manned by South Korean officers . <EOS> The recent flare-up over who owns the islands even spilled onto soccer the pitch during the final days of the London Olympics . <EOS> At the request of Japan , the International Olympic Commitee withheld the bronze medal from South Korean player Park Jongwoo after he held a banner during post-match celebrations supporting South Korea 's ownership of the islands . <EOS> An official from the Korean Football Association told CNN that the body had been asked to investigate the case by FIFA , soccer 's ruling body , and submit its results by Thursday . <EOS> `` It is proven from photos that Park 's action was not intentional . <EOS> He did n't make the sign , '' the official told CNN . <EOS> `` As you can see from photos , a fan was holding the sign during the match and Park got it from the fan .

'' <EOS> The remaining members of the humanitarian aid convoy are at the Turkish consulate in Benghazi , officials said . <EOS> Al-Barassi promised the results of the investigation would be made public and said those involved would stand trial soon . <EOS> He said the young women were wearing veils and `` Free Palestine '' T-shirts . <EOS> Two years after the start of the revolution and a bloody civil war that overthrew Libyan dictator Moammar Qadhafi in 2011 , the government is still struggling to exert its authority and control the hundreds of militias , most of which continue to operate freely across the country .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A lesbian couple has applied to adopt a child after Florida 's child advocacy agency announced it wo n't fight a court ruling that found the state 's ban on such adoptions unconstitutional . <EOS> Jennifer Haseman and Hillary Jovi , who were unaware of Tuesday 's announcement by the state , called Family Services of Metro Orlando , central Florida 's child protective contractor , to begin the process of adoption . <EOS> The couple believed they could make their dream a reality after a September decision by the Third District Court of Appeal that lifted Florida 's three-decade ban on gay adoption . <EOS> `` We 've wanted to adopt ever since we discussed wanting a family , '' said Jovi , who said she has had a 12-year relationship with Haseman . <EOS> `` We always wanted to have our own children and adopt . '' <EOS> The couple , formerly from New York , had considered moving back there just for the opportunity to adopt a child . <EOS> Both women have battled infertility . <EOS> The Florida Department of Children and Families said any appeal by the state agency was likely to be unsuccessful following opinions from the appeal court and a circuit court judge in Miami . <EOS> Gov. Charlie Crist ordered the department to stop enforcing the ban after the circuit court ruling . <EOS> `` I do n't think for us it is about sexual orientation so much as it is about a kid that deserves a second chance with a good parent or parents , '' said DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner . <EOS> The ACLU of Florida represented licensed foster parent Frank Martin Gill , who wanted to adopt two boys who had been placed in his care after the Department of Children and Families removed them from their home for neglect . <EOS> He sued to have the adoption ban overturned . <EOS> `` We are happy to hear that DCF wants to bring this case to an end and allow the Gill family to get on with their lives , '' said Howard Simon , ACLU of Florida executive director . <EOS> But , the director says , the case is not yet final . <EOS> `` What is needed now is a similar statement from Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum that will formally end this case and allow judges to decide -- on a case-by-case basis -- what is in the best interests of children .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama has ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA-backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001 . <EOS> In an exclusive , CNN talked with President Obama in Ghana about his order to review alleged deaths of Taliban . <EOS> `` The indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention , '' Obama told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview during the president 's visit to Ghana . <EOS> The full interview will air 10 p.m. Monday . <EOS> `` So what I 've asked my national security team to do is to collect the facts for me that are known , and we 'll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up , '' Obama said . <EOS> The inquiry stems from the deaths of at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners who had surrendered to the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001 . <EOS> The fighters were in the custody of troops led by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum , a prominent Afghan warlord who has served as chief of staff of the country 's post-Taliban army . <EOS> Dostum , a former communist union boss and militia leader who fought against the U.S.-backed mujahedeen in the 1980s , is known for switching sides as Afghanistan 's political conflict has evolved . <EOS> When the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington , Dostum sided with the Americans and received military and CIA support to battle the Taliban . <EOS> The allegations against him first surfaced in a 2002 Newsweek report , which cited a confidential U.N. memo saying the prisoners died in cramped container trucks while being transported from their Konduz stronghold in northern Afghanistan to Sheberghan prison , west of Dostum 's stronghold at Mazar-e Sharif . <EOS> At the time , the Boston , Massachusetts-based group Physicians for Human Rights said it found a mass grave in nearby Dasht-e Leili , where witnesses said the bodies of Taliban prisoners were buried . <EOS> The finding prompted U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks , who led the invasion of Afghanistan , to support an investigation into the allegations . <EOS> But The New York Times , citing government officials and human rights organizations , reported Friday that the Bush administration `` repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode . '' <EOS> State Department officials recently have tried to derail Dostum 's reappointment as military chief of staff to Afghan President Hamid Karzai , the newspaper reported , citing several senior officials who suggested the administration `` might not be hostile to an inquiry . '' <EOS> Dostum , a key ally of Karzai , was reportedly living in exile in Turkey until last month , when he was reinstated to his post as defense minister . <EOS> He had left Afghanistan over allegations that he had kidnapped Akbar Bai , a former ally turned political rival . <EOS> When asked by CNN about whether Obama would support an investigation , the president replied , `` I think that , you know , there are responsibilities that all nations have , even in war . <EOS> And if it appears that our conduct in some way supported violations of laws of war , then I think that , you know , we have to know about that . '' <EOS> Watch part of CNN 's exclusive interview with the president Susannah Sirkin , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights , on Sunday praised Obama `` for ordering his national security team to collect all the facts in the Dasht-e-Leili massacre and apparent U.S. cover-up . '' <EOS> `` U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating jointly and accepted the surrender of the prisoners jointly with General Dostum 's forces in northern Afghanistan , '' Sirkin said earlier in the week . <EOS> `` The Obama administration has a legal obligation to determine what U.S. officials knew , where U.S. personnel were , what involvement they had , and the actions of US allies during and after the massacre . <EOS> These questions , nearly eight years later , remain unanswered .

For the majority of people in the West banking is as easy as walking to a local branch or ATM , or logging into their account from a computer . <EOS> But for millions in developing countries , even having a bank account is out of reach . <EOS> In India , at least , that could be about to change . <EOS> Vodafone India and ICICI Bank , India 's largest private bank , have launched M-Pesa , a mobile-based money transfer and payment service that was first established in Kenya in 2007 . <EOS> The partnership , announced in a news release April 17 , claims it will give mobile-banking access to some 700 million Indian people who are currently `` unbanked '' -- people with no access to conventional banking services like bank branches and ATMs . <EOS> Vodafone says service will first rollout in India 's eastern regions , including Kolkata and West Bengal , with 8,300 agents . <EOS> That part of India is home to about 220 million people . <EOS> Service will eventually be extended across the rest of the country . <EOS> The M-Pesa system -- where `` M '' stands for mobile and `` pesa '' is the Swahili word for money -- begins with real cash and an M-Pesa agent . <EOS> A customer signs up , registers a personal mobile phone number and deposits money into the linked account at an agent store , which could be a mobile phone shop , a gas station or a supermarket . <EOS> To send money , the user inputs a recipient 's mobile phone number , the amount of money to send and a security code for protection . <EOS> To withdraw funds , the receiver visits an M-Pesa agent and requests a withdrawal through his or her mobile phone . <EOS> Both the receiver and the M-Pesa agent then receive a confirmation for withdrawal , which instructs the agent to give the customer cash . <EOS> Bills can be paid and mobile talk time can also be bought through the platform . <EOS> `` For millions of people in India , a mobile phone is a bank account , a front door to a micro-business or a lifeline to people in the remotest areas , '' said Marten Pieters , Managing Director and CEO of Vodafone India . <EOS> `` Research shows that M-Pesa brings real benefits to users in their daily lives , saving three hours a week of their time and around $ 3 in money transfer costs -- a significant amount to people in some areas . '' <EOS> Greater cell phone penetration also brings greater economic benefit to local economies , often far removed from urban centers in large developing countries . <EOS> A 2006 University of Michigan study found that every 10 % increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6 % . <EOS> In 2011 , India alone added 142 million new mobile phone subscriptions -- twice as many as in the whole of Africa , and more than in Europe , the Middle East and the former Soviet republics combined , according to the International Telecommunication Union -LRB- ITU -RRB- in a June 2012 report . <EOS> Between 2000 and 2011 , India recorded an enormous boom in cell phone subscriptions -- growing from just 3.5 million to more than 893 million . <EOS> In that same time , China saw mobile phone subscriptions increase more than ten-fold to more than 986 million subscriptions . <EOS> The United States saw growth of just 87 % over the same dozen years to 290 million , says the ITU .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fashion season is once again upon us . <EOS> Celebrities , trendsetters and buyers across the world will adorn the front rows of countless runways as the sartorially elite reveal their style edicts for the season ahead . <EOS> Last week , CNN 's African Voices teamed up with one of fashion 's finest -- Ethiopian supermodel , designer and maternal health advocate Liya Kebede to offer an exclusive insight into her multi-faceted world . <EOS> Kebede posted a daily diary of her life using Instagram to show us mere mortals the events and meetings she attended , all the while reflecting on how her roots have shaped the woman she is today . <EOS> Who is Liya Kebede ? <EOS> Born in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia in 1978 , Kebede had been attending the French Lycee when she was scouted by a French film director and so began her rise to the top . <EOS> Upon finishing her education , she joined a Parisian modeling agency before moving to Chicago and then New York . <EOS> When she hit the Big Apple , there was no turning back . <EOS> In the fall of 2000 , the multi-talented designer and future director Tom Ford handpicked Kebede to walk the catwalk for his autumn/winter Gucci collection . <EOS> It was the big break Kebede had been waiting for . <EOS> A year later , she would sit for prolific photographer Patrick Demarchelier for Harper 's Bazaar , feature as cover girl on numerous fashionista bibles including Vogue and tread the runways for Chanel , Dolce and Gabbana , Burberry and Fendi , to name a few . <EOS> Despite the supermodel success , Kebede has never forgotten where she came from . <EOS> When an opportunity arose to launch her own fashion line , Lemlem -- meaning `` to flourish or bloom '' in Amharic -- in 2007 , Kebede drew inspiration from her native land . <EOS> She embraced the traditional hand-woven style from back home , in the hope of offering employment and business opportunities for the country 's long-established weavers , and incorporated it into her collections . <EOS> `` The core of our collection is handwoven and made with handspun thread . <EOS> We use a textured fabric this season in our scarves and tunics that is traditionally used for Ethiopian wedding dresses , '' she tells CNN . <EOS> `` Supporting Ethiopian weavers and their craft has remained our central mission and we 're proud we can sell a beautiful product while also helping these artisans thrive . '' <EOS> Returning to her roots Kebede also works tirelessly to put a spotlight on the needs of millions of mothers and newborns in Ethiopia through her philanthropy , The Liya Kebede Foundation , launched in 2005 alongside her appointment as a World Health Organization goodwill ambassador , a position she held until 2011 . <EOS> The foundation supports training , and education about safe birth delivery services with the aim to substantially reduce preventable deaths in communities like the ones she grew up near . <EOS> As a mother of two , it 's a cause close to her heart . <EOS> `` I have always felt committed to women 's causes and the maternal health issue in particular spoke to me after I had my two children . <EOS> I was stunned when I first learned that a woman was dying every minute in my home country and other developing nations from complications of pregnancy and childbirth . '' <EOS> She adds : `` Of all the Millennium Development Goals set to reduce global poverty , there has been the least progress toward reaching the goal for improved maternal health . <EOS> It shows how far we have yet to go to make sure that the health system works in the best interest of women . '' <EOS> A supermodel , businesswoman , philanthropist , activist and mother -- that 's a lot of hats and yet Kebede remains humble about it all . <EOS> `` I think most women are very good at juggling things -- we learn it from our moms ! <EOS> When you love what you do a busy week is n't a chore -- it 's more a question of how to prioritize to put your best effort into each area . '' <EOS> Explore the interactive timeline above for a glimpse into Kebede 's world .
Affirmative action -- which is coming up before the Supreme Court on Wednesday in Fisher v. University of Texas -- has long been one of America 's most divisive social policies . <EOS> But it does n't need to be . <EOS> Universities engage in many forms of affirmative action that are uncontroversial , such as efforts to reach out and encourage minority applicants , or initiatives to make sure that admissions officers are going beyond test scores to find the strongest candidates . <EOS> The battle is really about the use of racial preferences in admissions , especially the large preferences often used by selective schools that , in effect , add a full point to the high school grade-point average of every black applicant , and half a point to every Hispanic applicant , or otherwise adjust the academic qualifications of black and Hispanic applicants so as to make them appear , for purposes of comparison with white and Asian applicants , much more academically prepared than they actually are . <EOS> These policies are often justified as ways of ensuring fair minority representation -- which , in turn , is supposed to foster a better learning environment for everyone . <EOS> But a growing stack of carefully vetted research is finding that these large preferences often undermine the very goals they are intended to promote , because they do a poor job of matching students to the college environments in which they are most likely to thrive . <EOS> A student who would do extremely well at Wake Forest ends up at struggling at Duke ; a student who would thrive at a strong state university gets recruited away to the Ivy League and becomes a marginal student . <EOS> News : The young woman at the center of the SCOTUS challenge For example , students who aspire to careers in science or engineering -LRB- STEM fields -RRB- , and who get into a school where they are surrounded by academically stronger students , have low odds of actually getting a STEM degree . <EOS> Yet these students have what it takes to have a successful career in STEM -- if they go to the right school . <EOS> A careful study led by University of Virginia psychologist Fred Smyth found that the well-matched minority students were nearly 80 % more likely to achieve their STEM aspirations . <EOS> Three other studies have confirmed Smyth 's findings . <EOS> In Fisher -- the case before the Supreme Court -- the University of Texas reintroduced racial preferences in 2004 because , it said , it wanted to achieve racial balancing of minority students in its classes . <EOS> But it has pursued this goal with very large preferences , and since these students are likely to retreat from the most competitive and rigorous classes to softer fields , the use of racial preferences can easily have little or no effect at all upon classroom integration . <EOS> The mismatch problem undermines diversity goals in other ways , too . <EOS> Undisputed research has found that students are more likely -LRB- holding other things , such as race , constant -RRB- to make friendships with other students who have comparable levels of academic preparation . <EOS> When colleges use large preferences , they interfere with social assimilation , and the minorities who are the `` beneficiaries '' of these preferences often feel socially isolated and self-segregate . <EOS> Indeed , preferences that are so large that they produce disparities in academic performance across racial lines are likely to foster negative stereotypes -- just the opposite of what diversity programs are supposed to achieve . <EOS> In short , large racial preferences , and indeed large preferences of any other kind -LRB- e.g. , for children of alumni , for athletes , etc. -RRB- are often counterproductive . <EOS> Yet universities continue to use them , partly because they may not understand the consequences of mismatch , but mainly because they are under tremendous pressure to achieve a particular racial balance -- at whatever cost -- in their student bodies . <EOS> These are exactly the situations where government regulation has a helpful role to play , and the Supreme Court is poised to play it . <EOS> News : Affirmative action under pressure in Supreme Court Many observers are predicting that the court , with five conservative votes , will simply abolish racial preferences . <EOS> That strikes us as unlikely ; Justice Anthony Kennedy , the swing vote , is more likely to put teeth in the court 's earlier holdings and simply create some tougher tests that universities must satisfy if they use racial preferences . <EOS> Two reforms seem to us particularly important : Find a way to limit the overall size of racial preferences , and mandate a thorough transparency at any university that wants to use them . <EOS> Limiting the size of racial preferences means making smaller , race-based adjustments to applicant qualifications -- or , to put it differently , not ignoring very wide differences in academic preparation across racial lines . <EOS> And by transparency we mean three things : Disclose to applicants the way that admissions decisions are made , provide information about how students such as the applicant have fared at that university , and make some form of all this information available to the public and to watchdog groups . <EOS> In other words , students need to have all available information about whether they are jeopardizing their success in college by accepting a large preference into a more elite school . <EOS> These sorts of reforms would represent a radical departure from past practices ; they would create a level of accountability that simply does not exist in colleges today . <EOS> And they would almost certainly moderate the use of a controversial and often ineffective tool of social policy -- racial preferences -- without the heavy hand of a complete ban .
Conjoined twins born at an Atlanta hospital have died , their parents said , less than two days after they beat the odds simply by coming into the world . <EOS> Eli and Asa Hamby shared a torso , heart , arms and legs . <EOS> They had separate spinal columns to support their heads . <EOS> Doctors at Atlanta 's Northside Hospital delivered the boys Thursday morning , then transferred them to Children 's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston , parents Michael and Robin Hamby wrote on their Facebook page , where they posted frequent updates on their boys . <EOS> Late Friday , the parents posted a tearful video in which they announced their boys had died that evening . <EOS> `` They fought long and hard , '' Michael Hamby said . <EOS> `` They -LRB- were -RRB- doing real good last night , had no problems other than little breathing problems . <EOS> ... They was holding their own , and early this morning they started to have heart issues . '' <EOS> He said one side of their heart was beating more quickly than the other and the heart rate reached 300 beats per minute , despite medicine to try to bring it down . <EOS> Staff then sedated the boys and doctors allowed Robin , still recovering from her cesarean section , to leave her hospital bed to be with them . <EOS> `` We sang to the boys and prayed over them , and our families got to love on them and tell them how much we love them , '' Robin said in the video . <EOS> `` They took them off the ventilators , and about 45 minutes -LRB- later -RRB- , Eli and Asa went on to sleep , to be with the Lord , '' Michael said . <EOS> Births of conjoined twins are rare , happening once every 200,000 live births , according to the University of Maryland Medical Center . <EOS> About 40-60 % of conjoined twins arrive stillborn , and about 35 % survive only one day . <EOS> The overall survival rate of conjoined twins is between 5 % and 25 % . <EOS> The Hambys are from near Phenix City , Alabama , and have a daughter , Selah , who is almost 2 . <EOS> `` It 's hard losing two kids at one time , '' Michael said . <EOS> `` Even though I only got to be with them a little over 24 hours , it feels like a lifetime . <EOS> I do n't wish this hurt on anybody . '' <EOS> Robin called the boys `` beautiful '' and had said late Thursday they were even offering glimpses of their different personalities . <EOS> Pictures on Facebook showed the parents beaming as they held their babies , swaddled tightly with hats on their heads . <EOS> `` They looked so much like Michael . <EOS> They were just the cutest little things . <EOS> They were so , so sweet , '' Robin said . <EOS> The parents said their Christian faith had grown stronger ever since the boys came into their lives . <EOS> `` I know they 're in heaven and they 're waiting on me , '' Michael said . <EOS> `` God is good . '' <EOS> Said Robin , `` God gave us extra time with them that some parents do n't get to have , because a lot of babies are stillborn that are conjoined twins , and we had almost two days . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jupiter is sporting a new scar after an unseen object hit the gaseous planet this week , NASA scientists say . <EOS> This NASA image shows a large impact near Jupiter 's southern pole . <EOS> An amateur astronomer in Australia noticed the new mark -- seen through telescopes as a dark spot -- on the planet early Monday and tipped off scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory -LRB- JPL -RRB- in Pasadena , California , who then confirmed it was the result of a new impact , NASA said . <EOS> It 's not clear what the object was that crashed into Jupiter 's poisonous atmosphere . <EOS> Glenn Orton , a JPL scientist , told the magazine New Scientist that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in Jupiter 's neighborhood , or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to have detected before impact . <EOS> The object created a mark on Jupiter that has the about same diameter as Earth , though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across , said Anthony Wesley , the amateur astronomer who first noticed the scar . <EOS> The mystery object was likely moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers -LRB- 31 to 62 miles -RRB- per second when it struck near Jupiter 's south pole , Wesley told CNN . <EOS> `` That generates an unbelievable amount of energy when it collides with pretty much anything , but especially with something the size of Jupiter , '' he said . <EOS> It is only the second time scientists have been able to observe the results of such an impact on Jupiter . <EOS> The first happened 15 years ago , when comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into 21 pieces and hit the planet 's atmosphere . <EOS> `` Given the rarity of these events , it 's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations , '' JPL astronomer Leigh Fletcher said in a NASA interview . <EOS> Thermal images taken by NASA show the scar as a bright spot , which means the crash warmed the lower atmosphere in that area , New Scientist said . <EOS> Researchers also found hints of higher-than-normal amounts of ammonia in the upper atmosphere . <EOS> The Shoemaker-Levy comet also churned up extra ammonia , the magazine said . <EOS> Jupiter 's new spot is n't likely to last long -- probably just one to two weeks , Wesley said . <EOS> He pointed out the impact scars from the Shoemaker-Levy debris lasted only two to three weeks before disappearing . <EOS> Seeing an Earth-sized spot appear so tiny on Jupiter 's surface led to some to wonder Tuesday whether our planet might be in danger of a similar collision . <EOS> But Wesley said that should n't be a concern because Jupiter functions almost like a celestial vacuum cleaner , sucking up any objects that would be of danger to Earth and its neighbors . <EOS> `` Jupiter is doing a very good job in scooping up a lot of this material that 's still floating around in the solar system , '' he said . <EOS> `` It 's just got so much gravity as it swings around the outer part of the solar system , it can really pull in and swallow up many of the cometary objects and debris left over from the formation of the solar system . <EOS> `` So it 's doing a good job in keeping us safe by cleaning out a lot of these bits and pieces . '' <EOS> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system . <EOS> Its colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium , with tiny amounts of methane , ammonia , phosphine , water , acetylene , ethane , germanium , and carbon monoxide . <EOS> The chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of Jupiter 's clouds . <EOS> The temperature at the top of those clouds is about 230 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -LRB- 145 degrees below zero Celsius -RRB- , but it is far hotter near the planet 's center . <EOS> The core temperature may be about 43,000 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 24,000 degrees Celsius -RRB- , hotter than the surface of the sun . <EOS> The most outstanding feature on Jupiter 's surface is the Great Red Spot , a storm of gas that swirls at a speed of about 225 miles -LRB- 360 kilometers -RRB- per hour at its edge . <EOS> The spot -- which has been shrinking -- has a diameter equal to about three times that of Earth .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are typically two types of comic book movies -- movies like `` Ghost Rider '' and movies like `` Batman Begins . '' <EOS> That is , there are some comics that should be really good movies , but because of a bad script , director or actors -LRB- sometimes all of the above -RRB- they end up cinematic duds like `` Ghost Rider . '' <EOS> And there are some comics that make the transition to the big screen really well with the help of great writers , directors and actors , like `` Batman Begins . '' <EOS> Movie producers are bringing a fairly serious comic book character , DC Comics ' `` Jonah Hex , '' -LRB- played by Josh Brolin -RRB- to the big screen on Friday . <EOS> The trailer from Warner Brothers -LRB- whose parent company , Time Warner , also owns CNN -RRB- looks like it 's anything but . <EOS> Early reviews are n't kind . <EOS> By mid-Friday morning , the film had earned a rotten 11-percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes . <EOS> If you 're not already familiar with the character , here 's the gist : As a boy , Jonah Hex 's drunk and abusive father sells him to an Apache tribe . <EOS> Hex lives with the Apaches as a slave but wins the favor of the chief and becomes a free member . <EOS> He gets separated from the tribe as an adult , ends up fighting for the Confederates in the Civil War -- even accidentally shooting Stonewall Jackson -- and ultimately wanders out West . <EOS> But when he comes back to the tribe , a fight with a rival leads to his banishment and a new life as a bounty hunter . <EOS> See Techland 's brief history of Jonah Hex . <EOS> The original run of the comic spanned the 1970s and 1980s , but the title was revived in the early 1990s and more recently in 2006 . <EOS> In later issues of the first run , Hex would be pulled through time , meeting up with Batman and a handful of other DC superheroes . <EOS> `` Jonah Hex '' falls prey to a common problem with comics-turned-movies : The stories span years , sometimes decades . <EOS> Most fans are only familiar with a comic book 's story from the point when they start reading . <EOS> But even so , fans of Jonah Hex know him as the star of a Western comic , not a superhero comic . <EOS> Hollywood producers , however , know DC Comics as a powerhouse of superheroes , and they seem to have different expectations of `` Jonah Hex . '' <EOS> Based on the trailer , Hex now has mystical and magical abilities to raise and speak with the dead . <EOS> His place in the Civil War is downplayed . <EOS> There are no major characters who are Native American . <EOS> Megan Fox stars as a gun toting prostitute , a never-before-seen friend of our hero . <EOS> And `` Q '' from the James Bond franchise apparently had forerunners in frontier towns who provide Hex with horse-mounted Gatling guns and hand-held , dynamite-firing crossbows . <EOS> Hex 's story should make a good movie . <EOS> `` Jonah Hex '' should be one of those comic-based movies that does n't need many changes to work . <EOS> But instead of trying to stay true to the comic , it appears that producers are hoping to attract a casual movie-going audience by sacrificing the original flavor of the character and story . <EOS> The result appears to be a campy movie that alienates both fans and regular moviegoers . <EOS> Looks like we 're in `` Ghost Rider '' territory .
Mohamed ElBaradei , who is said to be a candidate for Egypt 's interim prime minister following a military coup , has been regarded as an outsider in his native land because of his international achievements as a diplomat and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize . <EOS> An above-the-fray image hurt him when he unsuccessfully ran for president last year in the country 's first democratic elections following the 2011 ouster of despotic President Hosni Mubarak . <EOS> At the time , ElBaradei was a Johnny-come-lately to the long grind of ground-level politics . <EOS> As if to prove naysayers wrong , ElBaradei stayed in the fight for Egypt 's post-revolution government , and he endured as a reformer , becoming an opposition leader . <EOS> Mohamed ElBaradei : Fast Facts Now ElBaradei could possibly land deep inside Egypt 's power structure , in the nation 's capital where he was born 71 years ago . <EOS> His political party 's claim Saturday -- that ElBaradei was chosen to become interim prime minister -- was contradicted later in the day by a spokesman for Interim President Adly Mansour , who said a decision had yet to be made . <EOS> `` I hope I 'll be the minence grise , '' ElBaradei told CNN this week , with a measure of laughter . <EOS> `` I 'm getting on with the years ... and I think I 'll be much more effective . <EOS> `` As a lawyer I want always to be within the bounds of constitutional legality but ... we still are between a rock and hard place , '' he continued . <EOS> `` Either you risk a civil war -- and we have quite a few of them around us -- or , as I said , take extra-constitutional measures to ensure that we get the country together . '' <EOS> Like his father , ElBaradei studied law , earning a bachelor 's degree at University of Cairo . <EOS> He then left the country , traveling as a diplomat . <EOS> By 1974 , he earned a doctorate in international law from New York University , and a decade later , he joined the International Atomic Energy Agency -- which proved to be a brilliant career move because it eventually led him and the agency to share the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 . <EOS> ElBaradei served as chief of the atomic agency for 12 years . <EOS> He and the agency won the honor for their work to curb nuclear proliferation . <EOS> As director general of the IAEA , he even challenged President George W. Bush 's claims that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program before Bush ordered a coalition-supported invasion of Iraq in early 2003 . <EOS> With those international laurels , ElBaradei was among those who successfully pushed for the ouster of Mubarak after 30 years as president . <EOS> Still , ElBaradei was considered an above-it-all technocrat who was viewed as an unlikely presidential candidate , though he did join anti-Mubarak protests in Egypt despite receiving death threats . <EOS> He had no official protection during his participation in those protests . <EOS> ElBaradei was reportedly placed under house arrest by Egyptian authorities , but he defied a government curfew and went to Cairo 's Tahrir Square to join protests in January 2011 . <EOS> The next month , Mubarak stepped down . <EOS> In March 2011 , ElBaradei announced he was running for president , and 10 days later , thugs attacked his car , keeping him from voting in a constitutional referendum . <EOS> The next month , he returned to his first love -- diplomacy and atomic weapons -- and published a book , `` The Age of Deception : Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times . '' <EOS> The publisher 's blurb states that `` ElBaradei takes us inside the nuclear fray , from behind-the-scenes exchanges in Washington and Baghdad to the streets of Pyongyang and the trail of Pakistani nuclear smugglers . <EOS> He decries an us-versus-them approach and insists on the necessity of relentless diplomacy . '' <EOS> If that was a campaign strategy , it did n't work : In January 2012 , he quit the presidential race . <EOS> In an example of how politics can make for strange bedfellows , ElBaradei then criticized the interim military government -- the same military that has now put him in power -- for failing to bring about `` a real democratic system . '' <EOS> It 's clear now , however , that ElBaradei has the attention of Egypt 's generals .
Miami -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the Florida Keys last week , throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the `` scariest thing '' that 's ever happened to her , she said . <EOS> The woman , Jenny Hausch , was on the chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children , taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water . <EOS> `` These eagle rays , they were flying through the air , '' said Kelly Klein of Two Chicks Charters , the captain of the boat . <EOS> `` These giant things go out of the water and slam back down . '' <EOS> Hausch said she was in the front of the boat , snapping away . <EOS> `` The first picture I took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us , '' she said . <EOS> When the ray jumped again , Hausch said she was readying her camera . <EOS> `` Next thing I know , it hit me square in the chest . <EOS> I fell backwards and fell down , '' she said . <EOS> Klein said the ray kept `` slamming and slamming on top of -LRB- Hausch -RRB- , trying to swim away . '' <EOS> Hausch said the incident happened so fast that she did n't have time to react . <EOS> `` I was just trying to push it off me as I was scooting backwards , '' she said . <EOS> Hausch 's husband and children watched in horror . <EOS> Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers Aja Vickers and Bret Swensson were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams . <EOS> `` We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem , '' said Vickers . <EOS> As the officers made their way to the boat , Vickers said , `` shoes were getting thrown off the boat , towels were going everywhere . '' <EOS> By the time officers made it to the boat Hausch had freed herself from under the ray . <EOS> Klein said the animal measured 8-feet across , and probably weighed a good 300 pounds . <EOS> `` It 's just massive , it has a 10-foot tail , '' she added . <EOS> Klein said everyone thought that Hausch was dead , but when she was freed she did n't have a scratch on her . <EOS> Hausch said it was the scariest thing that 's ever happened to her , and she 's thankful she did n't get hurt . <EOS> Hausch 's children were hysterical , but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident would n't make them afraid of the water . <EOS> Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds , according to the Florida Museum of Natural History . <EOS> The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds . <EOS> In 2008 , a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys , but Vickers said both incidents were freak accidents . <EOS> `` This is a total one-in-a-million chance , '' she said . <EOS> `` These animals are n't attacking by any means . <EOS> One theory is these animals jump during mating season . ''
A small plane headed from New Jersey to suburban Atlanta crashed onto an interstate shortly after takeoff Tuesday , killing five people , authorities said . <EOS> Two men , one woman , two children and a dog aboard the plane died in the crash in Morristown , New Jersey , just after 10 a.m. ET , said Robert Gretz , a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board . <EOS> The plane , a six-seater Socata TBM700 , was headed from Teterboro , New Jersey , to DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in suburban Atlanta when it crashed onto Interstate 287 about 14 minutes into the flight , Gretz said . <EOS> The plane was at about 17,500 feet when `` there was some discussion between the pilot and the controller of locations of icing conditions , '' he said . <EOS> He told reporters Monday night the conversation seemed `` routine '' and was `` not a distress call . '' <EOS> Gretz said he did not know whether the conversation concerned a cloud that might contain ice ; actual icing on the airplane ; or whether the pilot was inquiring where ice might be or reporting it . <EOS> `` I 've heard this thirdhand . <EOS> ... That 's something I need to listen to the tapes to know , '' he said . <EOS> Gretz said he was not aware of any icing conditions on the ground at Teterboro that would have required the plane to be deiced . <EOS> However , he stressed that the investigation is in its infancy and it is too soon to speculate what might have caused the crash . <EOS> `` It 's too early to tell whether it was something mechanical or something the pilot did -- we just do n't know , '' he said . <EOS> Preliminary information is that the five were headed to Atlanta for a combination business-leisure trip , Gretz said . <EOS> Authorities did not release the names of those who died , pending positive identification by the medical examiner and notification of relatives . <EOS> But New York investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. reported that those on board were two of the firm 's managing directors , Jeffrey Buckalew , 45 , and Rakesh Chawla , 36 ; Buckalew 's wife , Corinne , and their two children , Jackson and Meriwether . <EOS> Ages for the children were not given . <EOS> `` The plane belonged to Mr. Buckalew , an experienced pilot whose passion was flying , '' the company said in a statement . <EOS> `` The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff 's family . '' <EOS> No one on the ground was injured , although a pickup truck narrowly missed the plane , Gretz said . <EOS> The debris field from the crash was spread over about a half-mile , with part of a wing and the plane 's tail found in a tree in a residential area , he said . <EOS> Witnesses reported the plane was in an `` uncontrolled spin '' before it crashed . <EOS> A Federal Aviation Administration radar facility in New York lost radio contact with the plane , and also lost it on radar , FAA spokesman Jim Peters said . <EOS> The crash site was about 30 miles southwest of the Teterboro airport , Peters said . <EOS> Gretz said Monday evening he was not sure how long after the conversation regarding icing that the plane dropped off radar , saying investigators will be determining that . <EOS> The plane struck the southbound lanes of I-287 , continued through a wooded median and came to rest on the northbound lanes , New Jersey State Police Lt. Stephen Jones said . <EOS> Most of the interstate was shut down after the crash , Jones said . <EOS> One northbound lane and two southbound lanes were open as of Tuesday afternoon , but officials were `` still trying to recover both the pieces of the plane and the remains of the victims . '' <EOS> Gretz said Monday night the wreckage recovery was halted about 6 p.m. because of darkness and would resume after Tuesday 's morning rush hour , at 9:30 a.m. . <EOS> The New Jersey Department of Transportation said motorists had two of three travel lanes in each direction available for Monday evening 's rush hour .
GLEN BURNIE , Maryland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At his GM dealership in suburban Washington , Maury Wilkins exudes calm as he gears up for an enormous challenge : protecting his decades-old family business . <EOS> Zero-percent financing is one way Maury Wilkins and other GM dealers are trying to lure new buyers . <EOS> With General Motors teetering on the edge of bankruptcy , Wilkins says luring customers back into his showroom boils down to two factors . <EOS> `` Everything is confidence and perception , '' Wilkins told CNN in a recent interview . <EOS> Confidence in the beleaguered General Motors Corp. is exactly what President Obama hopes to restore . <EOS> Even as he forced out GM 's CEO Rick Wagoner in late March , the president also made an extraordinary pledge . <EOS> `` If you buy a car from Chrysler or General Motors , you will be able to get your car serviced and repaired , just like always , '' Obama announced from the White House a week ago . <EOS> `` Starting today , the United States government will stand behind your warranty , '' the president said . <EOS> Some critics have blasted that promise as untenable . <EOS> `` That 's pie-in-the-sky , '' says William Holstein , author of `` Why GM Matters : Inside the Race to Transform an American Icon . '' <EOS> `` If General Motors goes away , how is the government ever going to maintain the network of suppliers ? '' <EOS> asks Holstein . <EOS> Noting there are `` four or five thousand moving parts in a vehicle , '' Holstein wonders , `` How is the government going to maintain this incredible infrastructure of suppliers to make sure that every part , every body panel is available for years after General Motors goes away ? <EOS> ... It 's impossible . '' <EOS> GM dealer Wilkins sees the government 's guarantee as a consumer confidence-builder . <EOS> Still , he 's concerned about slumping sales figures . <EOS> Nationwide , auto sales dropped 37 percent in March compared with a year ago . <EOS> Wilkins ' business was not immune . <EOS> Though he says he 's not in crisis mode , he does have contingency plans . <EOS> Watch report from CNN 's Elaine Quijano on Wilkins `` Our business model is ` what if , what if , what if , ' '' Wilkins said , adding , `` if all these things are outside of our control , how do we make sure that we maintain our profitability ? '' <EOS> That means extra attention to facets of his business besides new-car sales , including used-car sales , service and parts , and collision repair . <EOS> Already , Wilkins believes car sales have turned a corner . <EOS> He says February was one of his dealership 's best months . <EOS> It was the result , he believes , of business adjustments he made , including altering inventory stocks . <EOS> Wilkins also says credit for car buyers is finally beginning to loosen . <EOS> Potential customer Jim Lally says that 's what drew him into the showroom the day CNN visited . <EOS> `` I heard about the zero-percent financing and the exceptional deals that are being offered right now , '' Lally said . <EOS> While Lally had n't decided on whether to buy a GM , his visit was another reason for Wilkins ' cautious optimism , as his business tries to weather the economic storm .
Forget serious discussion about the future of America . <EOS> On social media -- from the snark-centric world of Twitter to the picture 's - worth-1 ,000 - insults pages of Tumblr -- it 's an ill-timed slip of the tongue that fires folks ' political passions . <EOS> And Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney served up a doozy Tuesday night with a weird turn of phrase that instantly launched `` binders full of women '' into the Internet 's lexicon . <EOS> First , some context . <EOS> When Romney and President Barack Obama were asked at Tuesday 's town hall debate what they would do to address salary equity issues for women , Romney instead told a story from when he was governor of Massachusetts . <EOS> He said he was considering applicants for his Cabinet and noticed that almost all of them were men . <EOS> So , the story goes , he made a point of recruiting women for the posts . <EOS> `` And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet , '' he said . <EOS> `` I went to a number of women 's groups and said , ` Can you help us find folks , ' and they brought us whole binders full of women . '' <EOS> Mere seconds later , commentary on the wording , which conjures up images of little black books or women literally being crammed into notebooks , was lighting up the Web -- and the Trapper Keeper 's role in the 2012 election had begun . <EOS> Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate `` Binders full of women is what they find in a serial killer 's apartment , '' zinged Adam Sternbergh of New York Times magazine . <EOS> `` Fonzie had binders of women too #debate #littleblackbook , '' added comedian Steve Agee . <EOS> Among social media 's finer binder creations : Tumblr -- Forget Obama 's perceived comeback . <EOS> The real winner of this debate was the `` Binders Full of Women '' Tumblr account . <EOS> As a repository for the Web 's wit , the quickly crafted page acted as home base for images goofing on the phrase . <EOS> Favorites ? <EOS> Celebrity chef Paula Deen riding a Trapper Keeper like a rodeo cowgirl and a Photoshopped Beyonce singing , `` If you liked it then you should have put three rings on it . '' <EOS> Twitter : The first presidential debate gave us Fired Big Bird and Big Bird Romney . <EOS> The vice presidential tilt spawned Laughing Joe Biden . <EOS> And this one was no different . <EOS> Long before Tuesday 's debate was over , Romney 's Binder was tweeting away . <EOS> Among its greatest hits : `` No comment on the rumors that Bill Clinton has already asked to borrow me . '' <EOS> Facebook -- It only took minutes for a handful of `` Binders Full of Women '' pages to spring up on the billion-strong site . <EOS> One had more than 291,000 likes on Wednesday afternoon . <EOS> A Facebook group with about 4,000 members provided offerings including a riff on `` Dirty Dancing '' -LRB- `` No one puts baby in a binder '' -RRB- . <EOS> Website -- BindersFullOfWomen.com is quite a bit more serious than the rest of the field . <EOS> Registered through GoDaddy on Tuesday night less than two minutes after Romney uttered the words , the site is funded by the liberal American Bridge political action committee . <EOS> The already well-populated site addresses a host of women 's issues , from domestic violence to health care .
An erratic Tropical Storm Debby stalled just off the Florida Panhandle on Monday evening , dumping sheets of rain on Florida 's Big Bend marshes and towns far down the peninsula . <EOS> Debby was already bringing up to 5 inches of rain per hour on parts of the Panhandle , and the National Hurricane Center said northern Florida could see another 6 to 12 inches in the next two days . <EOS> Forecasters declared a flash flood emergency for parts of Franklin , Liberty and Wakulla counties near Tallahassee until late Monday , and Debby drove rising tides across neighborhood streets as far south as the Tampa-St . <EOS> Petersburg area . <EOS> At 8 p.m. ET , Debby was centered 30 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola and was not moving . <EOS> It had top winds of 45 mph . <EOS> Tropical storm-force winds of 39-plus mph extended more than 230 miles from the center . <EOS> Tropical storm warnings were posted from the Panhandle resort of Destin to Englewood , about 50 miles south of Tampa . <EOS> Debby already has been blamed for one death in Venus , Florida , about 100 miles southeast of Tampa , when a woman died while trying to shelter her 3-year-old daughter during a tornado . <EOS> That Sunday afternoon twister flung 32-year-old Heather Town about 200 feet into the surrounding woods when it hit her home , the Highlands County Sheriff 's Office said Monday . <EOS> Neighbors found her still cradling her 3-year-old daughter , who was being treated at a Tampa hospital , `` She never let go of her little one even in death , '' Highland County Sheriff Susan Benton said in a statement issued Monday afternoon . <EOS> Another twister hit St. Pete Beach on Sunday night . <EOS> `` The winds started picking up , '' said Laura Miller , who took shelter in a space between her refrigerator and a kitchen pantry as it passed . <EOS> `` We heard the proverbial noise -- the train -- the transformer blew , the windows started busting out . <EOS> It was just very chaotic , all the glass flying , the debris flying into the house . <EOS> It was pretty intense . '' <EOS> The Sunshine Skyway bridge , which stretches over Tampa Bay and connects Bradenton with St. Petersburg , was closed Sunday because of high winds and remained closed Monday , Pinellas County officials said . <EOS> CNN iReporter Magalie Caragiorgio said Monday she has been stuck in her home in New Port Richey , near St. Petersburg , since Sunday because of flooding and has n't been able to get to her job as a nurse . <EOS> `` It 's unnerving because you ca n't do anything , '' she said . <EOS> `` I guess I was n't prepared . <EOS> I was n't expecting to be flooded out like this . '' <EOS> Citing the threat of heavy rainfall and potential tornadoes , Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency Monday `` so we can coordinate the use of all state resources to make sure we can respond promptly if anything happens . '' <EOS> Revised forecasts showed Debby remaining a tropical storm until it makes landfall early Thursday near Apalachee Bay , in the bend of the state where the Florida Panhandle ends . <EOS> The storm is then expected to cross the state and head into the Atlantic Ocean south of Jacksonville as a tropical depression on Saturday . <EOS> Debby has followed an uncertain path since forming over the weekend . <EOS> Storm warnings once stretched as far west as Morgan City , Louisiana , before shifting eastward on Sunday afternoon and Monday . <EOS> That raised concerns for crews working on 596 manned oil and gas production platforms throughout the Gulf , run by various companies . <EOS> Shell , BP and ExxonMobil began evacuating workers from offshore rigs on Sunday , but BP and Shell had made plans to return to those platforms as Debby turned toward Florida .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Doctors in Cuba detected and removed a cancerous tumor from Hugo Chavez 's body , the Venezuelan president announced in a speech broadcast on state-run VTV Thursday night . <EOS> Chavez said he was continuing treatment , but did not specify what that treatment entailed , where the tumor was located or when he would return to Venezuela . <EOS> The `` abscessed tumor with cancerous cells '' was discovered after doctors had already operated and treated a pelvic abscess , he said . <EOS> Doctors operated again without any complications and removed the tumor , he said . <EOS> Chavez said he was `` receiving complementary treatments to combat the different types of cells found , '' and that his condition continued `` evolving satisfactorily . '' <EOS> `` I wanted to speak to you with the sun of the dawn ... I think we have achieved it , thank God , '' he said . <EOS> Chavez appeared steady but subdued as he spoke , flanked by a large portrait of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar on one side and the Venezuelan flag on the other . <EOS> He frequently glanced down at his prepared text during the 15-minute speech.The performance showed none of the combative energy that normally characterizes his addresses , where he 'll speak extemporaneously for hours on end , skewering his opponents with gusto and sketching out the vision for his `` 21st-century socialism . '' <EOS> `` Throughout my life , I 've been making the fundamental error of neglecting my health and being reluctant to get checkups , '' he said , explaining how health concerns began to pop up earlier this month while he was in Cuba on a state visit . <EOS> Chavez closed his speech by saying , `` Now and always , we will live and we will overcome . <EOS> Thank you very much . <EOS> Until my return . '' <EOS> He gave no indication of any plans to delegate power during his treatment in Cuba . <EOS> Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua appeared on state television shortly after Chavez 's speech . <EOS> `` There is no time for sadness , but time for reflection , for courage and for work , '' he said , standing beside a group of government ministers . <EOS> `` Unity is what is required at this time . '' <EOS> Thursday 's speech was Chavez 's first on the state-run network since doctors in Cuba performed emergency surgery on the Venezuelan leader nearly three weeks ago . <EOS> The Venezuelan president 's typically frequent live television appearances have been absent from the country 's airwaves since doctors in Cuba first performed surgery to treat a pelvic abscess June 10 . <EOS> His lengthy stay in Cuba and notable low profile have fueled rampant speculation about his health . <EOS> Concerns about the seriousness of his condition intensified Wednesday after Venezuelan officials announced the postponement of a high-profile summit of Latin American leaders originally scheduled to take place in Venezuela next month . <EOS> The government cited Chavez 's `` strict process of recovery and medical treatment '' as the reason behind the decision , but provided few details about his health . <EOS> Over the weekend , several allies of Chavez denied that he had cancer . <EOS> On Tuesday and Wednesday , VTV broadcast video of Chavez walking and talking with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Havana . <EOS> The video showed Chavez , wearing his trademark track suit , talking with Castro and looking at Tuesday 's edition of the state-run Granma newspaper . <EOS> But while the video showed the pair acting chummy as they talked , neither leader addressed the Venezuelan president 's medical condition . <EOS> The images reaffirmed what Venezuelan officials have been saying , Jaua told state-run VTV Wednesday . <EOS> Chavez deserves to have the time he needs to recover from surgery , he said . <EOS> Journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report .
New York St. Patrick 's Day parade organizers Wednesday said they will allow the first ever LGBT group to march in 2015 with an identifying banner -- ending a longstanding ban that drew national criticism and corporate boycotts . <EOS> The group being allowed to march was the only LGBT affiliated group to apply , said William O'Reilly , a spokesman for parade organizers . <EOS> He said other LGBT groups can apply to march in 2016 . <EOS> The New York parade is the nation 's oldest . <EOS> O'Reilly said LGBT community members have always been encouraged to march under the traditional apolitical banners of other marching groups . <EOS> New York City 's St. Patrick 's Day parade , which has been held for more than 250 years , historically banned LGBT groups from marching under their own banner . <EOS> That 's changing . <EOS> Last March , Mayor Bill de Blasio declined to march in the Manhattan parade , and Mayor Martin Walsh sat out the event in Boston , where a similar ban remains in place . <EOS> Three of the country 's biggest beer companies also withdrew their sponsorships because gay and lesbians were excluded . <EOS> Sam Adams , owned by Boston Beer Co. , pulled out as a sponsor for the Boston parade , and Guinness and Heineken pulled out from the New York parade . <EOS> `` This is progress , '' de Blasio told reporters , adding that he needed more information before deciding whether to march next year . <EOS> `` What I 've called for for a long time is an inclusive parade . <EOS> This is a city of inclusion . '' <EOS> Gay rights advocates also applauded the change . <EOS> `` It 's about time , '' Sarah Kate Ellis , president of GLAAD , said in a statement . <EOS> `` Discrimination has no place on America 's streets , least of all on Fifth Avenue . <EOS> As an Irish-Catholic American , I look forward to a fully inclusive St. Patrick 's Day Parade that I can share with my wife and children , just as my own parents shared with me . <EOS> Until then , parade organizers must be held accountable to ending this ban once and for all . '' <EOS> In an interview , Ellis said de Blasio 's refusal to march and the loss of corporate sponsors were the `` straws that broke the camel 's back . '' <EOS> `` I 'm cautiously optimistic that this is definitely an important and historic step in the right direction but I will be watching to see how this unfolds over the next year , '' she said . <EOS> The gay group marching in New York this year is Out@NBCUniversal, a resource group of LGBT employees at NBCUniversal , according to O'Reilly . <EOS> `` WNBC-TV has long been the broadcast partner of the Parade , so there was a relationship already established , '' O'Reilly said via email . <EOS> In Boston , no change in policy has been announced but longtime gay activist Cathy Renna said she hoped the New York decision will `` make folks in Boston rethink their position . '' <EOS> `` They really need to get with the times , '' Renna said . <EOS> But Boston parade organizer Philip Wuschke . <EOS> Jr. told CNN that no change was planned . <EOS> `` Many gay people march in Boston 's St. Patrick 's Day Parade , '' he said . <EOS> Obama bars federal contractors from LGBT discrimination MLB names ` ambassador of inclusion '
BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coalition troops killed the al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the February 2006 attack on Samarra 's al-Askariya mosque and set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites , the U.S. military said Sunday . <EOS> The attack on Samarra 's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites . <EOS> Haitham Sabah al-Badri , the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra , was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra , said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference . <EOS> `` Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra , '' Fox said . <EOS> `` We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq . '' <EOS> Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri , according to a U.S. military news release . <EOS> During the raid , at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces , the release said . <EOS> The coalition forces called in close air support , killing al-Badri and the three others , the release said . <EOS> One of those killed was identified as a foreigner ; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives , the military said . <EOS> El-Badri 's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official . <EOS> No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque , one of the holiest Shiite sites , but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17 months since the attack . <EOS> In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque 's dome , another bombing in June destroyed the shrine 's two remaining minarets . <EOS> Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks , including two last year , Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers . <EOS> Samarra is in Salaheddin province , north of Baghdad . <EOS> Mortar attacks kill 11 Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad on Sunday , killing at least 11 people and wounding 15 others , a spokesman with Iraq 's Interior Ministry said . <EOS> The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. -LRB- 12 a.m. ET -RRB- , the spokesman said . <EOS> Suicide bombers attacked two gas stations Wednesday , killing 70 people , Reuters reported . <EOS> Meanwhile , coalition forces said Saturday they killed four suspected militants and detained 18 thought to have helped make or plant roadside bombs , the U.S. military said . <EOS> The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr 's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militias operating in Iraq , the military said . <EOS> Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldier 's sentence A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to 110 years in confinement for participating in the rape of a 14-year-old girl and the killings of her and her family in Iraq , an Army spokeswoman said . <EOS> The girl 's family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment and would have preferred to see the death penalty handed down in the case . <EOS> Pfc. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape , conspiracy to commit rape , housebreaking with the intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder . <EOS> The girl , her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya , south of Baghdad . <EOS> `` We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals and the place to carry out the sentence is where the incident happened , '' the girl 's cousin , Abu Ammar , told Reuters . <EOS> Her uncle , Hadi Abdullah , told the wire agency that family members wished there was a way to appeal the sentence so the death penalty could be imposed . <EOS> Three soldiers have previously pleaded guilty in the case and were given sentences ranging from five to 100 years . <EOS> The accused ringleader , former Pvt. Steven Green , was discharged from the Army and awaits trial in a civilian court . <EOS> Other developments CNN 's Pierre Bairin and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .
Wood as a building material is having a real comeback in contemporary Scandinavian design . <EOS> Bent into minimalistic circular structures and sculptural forms , it is used with surprising results thanks to engineering and technical innovations . <EOS> Offering a wealth of aesthetic possibilities , timber is now being hailed as the concrete of 21st Century . <EOS> Innovative architectural forms in wood was one of the central themes emerging during the World Design Capital year in Helsinki . <EOS> As the planet is threatened by an ecological crisis , showcasing and promoting new eco-friendly materials was a valuable objective in the WDC program -- a topic also extended to the Finnish Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale . <EOS> As exhibition designer Esa Vesmanen points out : `` The young generation of architects have taken up wood with an innovative approach , thinking about all its possibilities from a new perspective . '' <EOS> In Helsinki , at the Aalto University architecture school , a studio in timber design offers students the possibility for a particular focus . <EOS> A Summer Pavilion for the World Design Capital events was created by a team of students from an initial concept designed by Pyry-Pekka Kantonen . <EOS> `` As a living material , wood is both challenging and inspiring , '' Kantonen says . <EOS> The fact that wood is the most eco-friendly building material is an obvious reason for its use , but as Kantonen explains its aesthetic qualities are being rediscovered and appreciated again . <EOS> In public buildings , such as the Kilden Theater and Concert Hall in Kristiansand in Norway wooden surfaces have been cleverly used for psychological effects . <EOS> Juha Gronholm from the Finnish architectural studio ALA explains that the concert hall was conceived to feel as a musical instrument in itself . <EOS> The undulating form of the ceiling was built from local oak based on traditional boat construction principles . <EOS> Such a formal solution would have been impossible to make out of any other material . <EOS> In a similar way the Kamppi Chapel of Silence is an example of exquisite craftsmanship in the treatment of timber . <EOS> Erected in one of the busiest areas in Helsinki the chapel looks like a giant wooden bowl that has accidentally landed in the heart of the city and feels almost like a piece of conceptual art -- architecture with spiritual and intellectual connotations -- as sacred buildings should , of course . <EOS> Its setting is unusual and its circular form radically breaking traditional models of architecture . <EOS> In Nordic countries and in the Balkans , wood has always been part of the architectural heritage . <EOS> Weekends and holidays are still spent in waterfront log cabins and wooden cottages , but due to safety regulations -- and a disdain towards traditional materials in the 1960 's -- its use diminished in family house building . <EOS> Wood has been perceived as a modest material . <EOS> A sense of simplicity and truthfulness is still associated to all timber constructions . <EOS> In a world where our ecological footprint is continuously considered , the reality of wood being the new concrete looks plausible indeed . <EOS> Not only does wood absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , it also stores it in its finished form . <EOS> The entire lifecycle of wood from construction to recycling benefits the planet from an ecological perspective . <EOS> In countries where wood is a natural resource buildings made out of timber make perfect sense . <EOS> `` It would be crazy not to make the most of a material , which is renewable and responds to serious environmental threats , '' Kantonen says . <EOS> `` Producing concrete and steel takes huge amounts of energy . '' <EOS> He also believes that wooden buildings will attribute to a better society where people are more tolerant and open towards each other : `` There is a warmth in wood and I do n't just mean the physical characteristics . ''
That did n't take long . <EOS> Just two weeks since the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act , state legislatures are moving quickly on voter suppression measures . <EOS> Already , six of the nine states that were previously covered by the requirement that changes in voting procedures be pre-cleared have started to bring up restrictive voter ID laws . <EOS> If there is a glimmer of hope for voting rights advocates , however , it 's that the court merely ruled that the formula was outdated , and that Congress `` may draft another formula based on current conditions . '' <EOS> I agree with the court that indeed , the previous formula included in the Voting Rights Act does not address today 's attempts to restrict the right to vote . <EOS> In fact , I think it underestimates them . <EOS> Under the former formula used by the Voting Rights Act , nine entire states and certain counties and municipalities in six additional states were required to obtain federal preclearance before passing new voting laws . <EOS> But according to the Brennan Center for Justice , already in 2013 more than 30 states , including my home state of Wisconsin , have introduced more than 80 bills that would restrict the right to vote . <EOS> These bills would do everything from requiring photo identification at the polls , to limiting early voting opportunities , to creating burdensome registration requirements . <EOS> Although these efforts are not as blatant as previous voter suppression techniques such as literacy tests and violent intimidation , they are still discriminatory . <EOS> The victims of these voter suppression efforts are usually the same , no matter the state : minority and low-income voters , the elderly and students . <EOS> In a country built on the foundation of civic participation , voting should be our most fundamental right , the right that ensures all other rights we possess . <EOS> But the right to vote is , contrary to popular belief , not explicitly guaranteed by our Constitution . <EOS> Although the right is inherent or implied throughout our founding document , and amendments prohibit discrimination based on race , gender , and age , we possess no affirmative right to vote . <EOS> If we did , state lawmakers would n't continue to pass , and courts would not continue to uphold , these various restrictive voting laws . <EOS> So Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and I have proposed a solution that we believe accurately reflects the current voting rights landscape ; a solution that applies to all 50 states and protects the voting rights of all who call this country home . <EOS> This spring we introduced a `` Right to Vote '' amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would guarantee an affirmative right to vote for all Americans , no matter where they live . <EOS> Our amendment is both simple and absolutely necessary : It ensures that every American citizen possesses the fundamental right to vote in any public election where he or she resides , and empowers Congress with the authority to protect this right . <EOS> The consequences of this amendment would be profound for the rights of voters everywhere . <EOS> Now , it is the voter who has to demonstrate that his or her right to vote has been impeded by the state . <EOS> With the ratification of our amendment , the burden of proof would switch to the states , which would have to demonstrate that they possess a compelling interest to restrict a voter 's rights . <EOS> This would mean that all of the states who believe that we need voter ID laws to protect against a `` crisis '' of voter fraud would actually need to demonstrate that such a crisis existed . <EOS> Predictably , when an investigation into voter fraud was launched in Wisconsin in conjunction with proposed voter ID legislation , barely a case was found when someone had voted in place of someone else . <EOS> Other studies have found the same thing . <EOS> Voter ID laws to counter voter fraud represent little more than a cure in search of a disease , and states must be stopped from implementing these discriminatory measures . <EOS> While the recent dismantling of the Voting Rights Act is certainly disheartening , we have a chance to strengthen our fundamental right to vote . <EOS> As President Lyndon B. Johnson declared in 1965 to a joint session of Congress to encourage passage of the landmark legislation , `` There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right . '' <EOS> And there is no way that we can better protect that right than through a right to vote amendment to our Constitution .
Olivia Wise , a teenager who refused to let an inoperable brain tumor kill her spirit , died Monday . <EOS> Olivia gained fame in the last weeks of her 16-year-long life when a Katy Perry song she recorded in a Toronto studio in September became a viral hit online . <EOS> `` She died peacefully in her home surrounded by the extraordinary love of her family , '' a family statement sent to CNN said . <EOS> The teenager said that she did n't want people crying at her funeral , but that they should celebrate her life , her mother wrote in a letter to CNN . <EOS> Her version of Perry 's hit `` Roar , '' which she recorded in September after learning there were no more treatments available , drew the attention of Perry after it was published on YouTube in October . <EOS> `` I was very moved and you sounded great , '' Perry told her in a video posted on YouTube . <EOS> `` I love you . <EOS> A lot of people love you and that 's why your video got to me . <EOS> It moved everybody that saw it . '' <EOS> Perry concluded with : `` Keep roaring ! '' <EOS> The international attention drew more than a million viewers to Olivia 's song and helped raise $ 77,000 for the Liv Wise Fund that was started in her name in support of brain tumor research . <EOS> The video shows OIivia sitting in a wheelchair in the middle of the studio , singing softly at first and struggling with her breaths . '' <EOS> 'Cause I am a champion , and you 're gon na hear me roar . '' <EOS> Her energy grows and she smiles as she sings `` I got the eye of a tiger , a fighter , dancing through the fire . '' <EOS> `` Olivia is a fighter and has gone through the fire , '' her cousin wrote in the post under the video posting on YouTube . <EOS> `` In fact , she was going through the fire while she recorded this song , but you would n't know it , because she was dancing right through it . '' <EOS> Her family posted another song video on YouTube just days before Olivia 's death . <EOS> She wrote `` Simple Girl '' -- a song about how she wanted to live life -- when she was 11 . <EOS> The only time she sang it was on September 6 , during the same session in which she recorded `` Roar .

As residents of the U.S. Northeast grapple with the destruction wrought by Superstorm Sandy , an offer of assistance has come from an unlikely quarter : the leader of a radical Muslim group in Pakistan that Washington has branded a terrorist group . <EOS> `` We offer our unconditional support and help for the victims '' of the storm , Hafiz Mohammad Saeed , head of the Islamic charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa , said in a statement late Tuesday . <EOS> `` If U.S. government allows , we will send our doctors , relief and rescue experts , food and medicine on humanitarian grounds . '' <EOS> India accuses Saeed of masterminding the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people -- an allegation he denies . <EOS> The United States , which has declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa a terrorist organization and put up a $ 10 million reward for information leading to Saeed 's arrest and conviction , declined the offer . <EOS> `` While we have great respect for Islamic tradition of social assistance to those who are in need no matter where they might be , this particular offer strikes us as very hollow , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Wednesday . <EOS> Is Sandy a taste of things to come ? <EOS> Saeed said in the statement posted on Jamaat-ud-Dawa 's Facebook page Tuesday that despite the bounty and U.S. allegations about his organization , helping Americans struck by adversity is `` our religious and moral obligation . '' <EOS> `` Islam orders us to help them without discriminating between religion , cast or creed , '' he said in the statement , which was set against the backdrop of an apparently fabricated image of a scuba diver swimming through a submerged Times Square subway station . <EOS> His organization said on its Twitter account that it had previously carried out relief efforts following natural disasters in Sri Lanka and Indonesia . <EOS> Sandy 's impact : State by state The `` wanted '' notice for Saeed issued by the State Department 's Rewards for Justice program in April described him as a former professor of Arabic and engineering who helped found Jamaat-ud-Dawa , which aims to bring about Islamist rule in India and Pakistan . <EOS> The group 's military wing , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , which means army of the pure , is blamed for violence in the disputed territory of Kashmir aimed at liberating Muslims . <EOS> After the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in the United States , Lashkar-e-Tayyiba began operating outside Kashmir . <EOS> It is suspected of carrying out several high-profile attacks in India in the past few years . <EOS> How you can help storm victims The United States labeled it a `` foreign terrorist organization '' in December 2001 , and under pressure from Washington , Pakistan banned it in 2002 . <EOS> But the group continues to function freely . <EOS> After the U.S. government announced the reward for his capture in April , Saeed appeared on Pakistani television and seemed unruffled by the move . <EOS> `` I am living my life in the open and the U.S. can contact me whenever they want , '' he said . <EOS> Saeed said the Pakistani Supreme Court had cleared him and his organization of wrongdoing in relation to the Mumbai attacks in which gunmen stormed locations throughout Mumbai , killing scores of people and taking hostages . <EOS> Six American citizens were killed in the carnage . <EOS> `` The U.S. government is listening to the Indian lobby and not making its own decisions , '' Saeed said regarding the allegations against him . <EOS> He condemned the Mumbai attacks . <EOS> Pakistani authorities have refused to take him into custody , saying they have n't received `` concrete evidence '' against him . <EOS> The Indian government has issued a notice with Interpol against Saeed in relation to his alleged role in the attacks . <EOS> India accuses him of participating in the training of the gunmen in the Mumbai attack and has charged him in absentia . <EOS> Saeed has not been indicted in the United States , but the Treasury Department designated him and three other Lashkar-e-Tayyiba leaders as terrorists in 2008 . <EOS> It froze their assets in the United States and prohibited Americans from doing any business with them . <EOS> ` Heroic ' Iran , ` resistive ' Syria behind Sandy , pro-Assad group claims

It 's their fault , President Barack Obama said Monday in blaming Republican inaction on immigration reform for escalating problems including a surge of undocumented children crossing the border from Mexico . <EOS> At a hastily scheduled Rose Garden appearance , Obama said the top House Republican -- Speaker John Boehner -- told him last week that the chamber 's GOP majority will continue blocking a vote on a Senate-passed immigration bill . <EOS> In response , Obama said he was starting `` a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own , without Congress . '' <EOS> Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder will `` identify additional actions my administration can take within my existing legal authorities , to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can , '' the President said . <EOS> `` If Congress will not do their job , at least we can do ours , '' he said , adding he expected the recommendations by the end of summer and would act on them without delay . <EOS> `` The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security , is bad for our economy , is bad for our future , '' Obama said . <EOS> `` America can not wait forever for them to act . '' <EOS> Vilify Republicans Obama 's statement sought to vilify Republicans for the failure to get congressional approval for immigration reform , an issue important to his base . <EOS> `` Pass a bill . <EOS> Solve a problem . <EOS> Do n't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done , '' he said , repeating his contention that a bill would win bipartisan approval if Boehner allowed it to come to a vote in the House . <EOS> The right fate for immigrant kids Conservative Republicans oppose the Senate plan passed last year with support from both parties support because it includes a pathway to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the United States . <EOS> They also fear that such a reform measure would bolster already strong Democratic support among Hispanic Americans , the nation 's largest minority . <EOS> For his part , Boehner said Monday that Republicans do n't trust Obama to enforce laws they might pass . <EOS> `` Until that changes , it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue , '' he said in a statement after Obama spoke . <EOS> `` The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system . '' <EOS> `` Sad and disappointing '' He continued , `` It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama wo n't work with us , but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that ca n't and wo n't fix these problems . '' <EOS> Boehner noted that previous executive action by Obama to halt deportations of some undocumented children led to the current border crisis by `` giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay . '' <EOS> In his statement , Obama announced he was ordering a shift in security resources to border regions , and he promised the additional action he can take `` without Congress but within his existing authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as we can . '' <EOS> The President also sent Congress a letter asking that legislators work with him on providing additional money and leeway to deal with the situation on the southern border . <EOS> Border influx On Sunday , an administration official told CNN the money -- which could exceed $ 2 billion -- would go to securing appropriate space for the detention of children but also stemming the tide of immigrants . <EOS> The government hopes to increase its ability to investigate and dismantle smuggling organizations as well as quickly return children and adults to their home countries if they do not qualify for asylum , according to that official . <EOS> So far , the federal government has struggled to process and accommodate the influx of illegal human traffic but specifically the spike in children . <EOS> U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an `` immediate humanitarian crisis . '' <EOS> Earlier in June , the White House announced a plan to spend millions in a government-wide response by sending aide to governments in Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador to help with crime and violence prevention . <EOS> In mid-June , Vice President Joe Biden also spoke with leaders in the three countries as well as Mexico about working together to promote security . <EOS> Biden 's objective was to emphasize that adults arriving with their children in the United States do n't meet the requirements for a policy that defers deportation for children brought to the United States before June 15 , 2012 . <EOS> Obama also spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto about the issue and has warned families who see the dangerous trip as the best option for their children .
A US Airways plane blew a tire during takeoff Thursday evening at Philadelphia 's airport , an airline spokesman said , with witnesses recalling seeing the plane `` bounce '' before screeching to a halt . <EOS> Citing initial reports , US Airways spokesman Todd Lehmacher said the commercial airliner 's pilot decided to abort takeoff after the tire issue . <EOS> Philadelphia International Airport tweeted , and photos indicate , that the plane 's nose gear collapsed . <EOS> Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said two women from the plane were transported to the city 's Methodist Hospital , one with a minor injury and the other with a minor illness . <EOS> `` This is a good time , '' Ayers said , referring to the response and the fact things turned out as well as they did . <EOS> `` It worked out alright . '' <EOS> Flight 1702 was scheduled to take off at 5:50 p.m. and arrive in Fort Lauderdale about three hours later , according to US Airways ' website , though Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said the incident took place around 6:25 p.m. Watching from a nearby plane , Dave Olinger said , `` I saw the plane come down with its landing gear -LRB- hitting -RRB- the ground abnormally hard and it bounced back into the air . <EOS> Then it continued to try to land and it went out of my view as I saw a massive cloud of dust come up from behind it . '' <EOS> A witness in an airport terminal , posting to the online travel community FlyerTalk.com , reported seeing the plane `` bounce twice on takeoff . '' <EOS> Firefighters spotted smoke coming from one engine , but no fire . <EOS> Philadelphia Fire Department Deputy Chief Gary Loesch said crews sprayed `` a protective foam blanket '' around where `` hydraulic fluid ... was leaking from the front landing gear , '' saying this was only done as a precaution . <EOS> Images from the airport afterward showed the plane pitched forward , but otherwise upright , and surrounded by flashing emergency vehicles . <EOS> One showed the plane at a standstill as some people left from an emergency slide and others got out on the wing . <EOS> `` So my plane just crashed , '' tweeted one apparent passenger . <EOS> A short time later and minutes before taking a selfie at the scene , she added , `` I almost just died . '' <EOS> The 149 passengers and five crew members who had been aboard the Airbus A320 quickly got off , then were moved about 400 yards away into a field , according to Loesch . <EOS> They were surrounded by police and fire vehicles to block the wind , with women and children getting into these vehicles to stay warm in temperatures hovering around the freezing mark . <EOS> `` Most people were complaining about being cold , '' Loesch said . <EOS> Departing and incoming flights at the Pennsylvania airport were temporarily halted . <EOS> Some of them resumed around 6:55 p.m. , Peters said , though one runway remained closed for some time after that . <EOS> The incident caused significant travel headaches , and not just for those on Flight 1702 . <EOS> The airport noted there were departure delays of about one hour , with airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica saying arrival delays stretched up to two hours . <EOS> According to Joe Taney , the vice president of operations in Philadelphia for American/US Airways , Flight 1702 passengers were bused to the terminal and taken to one of the airline 's Admirals Clubs , which is typically for `` preferred members . '' <EOS> They remained there for some time , before they could collect items they had left on the plane . <EOS> Another aircraft was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale . <EOS> That plane had n't left by 10:30 p.m. , though it was supposed to head out soon . <EOS> `` There 's maybe a couple that chose not to go , which is fine ... , '' Taney said . <EOS> `` But overall the majority of people are choosing to go on that extra -LRB- flight -RRB- .

Many were in diapers , if they were born at all , during Whitney Houston 's heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s . <EOS> And yet they still feel a special connection to her -- and , today , share in the heartache of their parents and neighbors by virtue of the fact that they all call northern New Jersey home . <EOS> Mario Depeine said that students in the public middle school in Newark where he teaches can not stop talking about Houston , adding they are upset that there is no large-scale public memorial at which they can pay their respects . <EOS> Most were n't alive when she won her first Grammy Award , in 1986 , for best female pop performance for her song `` Saving All My Love For You . '' <EOS> Still , Depeine -- a CNN iReporter -- said the middle-schoolers know Houston 's music through their parents as well as her unique place in Newark lore . <EOS> `` They know her well , '' he said . <EOS> `` And they realize that she 's really connected to this community . '' <EOS> The legendary singer is hardly the first person born in Newark to make a mark on the world . <EOS> Comedian Jerry Lewis , musician Paul Simon and poet Allen Ginsberg , among many others , arose from the city of about 275,000 people , situated 10 miles west of New York City . <EOS> Yet Houston has a special connection because -- according to public leaders , family friends and other residents -- she never forgot her roots in Newark , where she was born , and nearby East Orange , where she moved to as a child . <EOS> Houston family 's farewell to be private `` It 's very sad because , in reality , she 's a part of here , '' said German Racines . <EOS> `` She is a little piece of Newark . '' <EOS> Pastor Joe Carter from New Hope Baptist Church in Newark , which Houston attended growing up , recalled how she would come sing at some Easter Sunday services even after she 'd made it big . <EOS> Others recalled fondly how Houston would often return to the area , treating neighbors and fellow church members like family . <EOS> `` It 's almost like she never left , '' said Sharpe James , a former Newark mayor who organized concerts for a young Houston as well as her mother , gospel singer Cissy Houston . <EOS> `` Here 's a superstar , but you could find her in Newark , at the church . <EOS> She was everywhere and everything to everyone . '' <EOS> Pride tied to her enormous talents , and her fame , are also part of her appeal in the Garden State . <EOS> Gov. Chris Christie told reporters Tuesday that he believes Houston belongs in the same class as Frank Sinatra , Count Basie and Bruce Springsteen as far as musical luminaries hailing from New Jersey . <EOS> To pay tribute , he said he plans to order all flags at government buildings be lowered to half-staff Saturday , the day of her funeral . <EOS> `` Whitney Houston was an important part of the cultural fabric of this state , '' said Christie . <EOS> `` She was a cultural icon in this state , and her accomplishments in her life were a source of great pride for the people of this state . '' <EOS> For some New Jerseyans , the songstress was an inspiration . <EOS> That 's particularly true at the Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts , a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade in East Orange , a few blocks from where the singer spent much of her childhood with her parents and two brothers . <EOS> Tearful students and staff remembered Houston -- a frequent visitor since the school was named in her honor about 15 years ago -- at a memorial event Monday . <EOS> In addition to speeches and the release of white balloons , her historic rendition of the national anthem before Super Bowl XXV was replayed . <EOS> Students told CNN affiliate WCBS afterward that Houston 's successes prove that there 's no limits for a girl from northern New Jersey . <EOS> `` I think that I can achieve whatever I want , just like she did , '' said eighth-grader Hailey Diasallen .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kyrgyzstan 's president signed a bill Friday to close an air base that the U.S. military uses as a route for troops and supplies heading into Afghanistan , the president announced on his Web site . <EOS> Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan serves as a U.S. supply route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan . <EOS> The news came as two other central Asian nations -- Tajikistan and Uzbekistan -- reportedly agreed to let U.S. cargo pass through their countries on the way to Afghanistan . <EOS> Such deals , if confirmed , could help fill the void left by the closing of the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan . <EOS> The Kyrgyz order became effective on Friday when President Kurmanbek Bakiyev reportedly signed legislation that the parliament in Bishkek backed on Thursday , the Pentagon said . <EOS> Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry on Friday officially notified the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek that a 180-day withdrawal process is under way . <EOS> Embassy spokeswoman Michelle Yerkin told CNN the United States hopes to retain the base . <EOS> Officials in Washington and Bishkek signed a deal three years ago allowing the United States to renew the arrangement annually through July 2011 . <EOS> `` We do remain in contact with the government of Kyrgyzstan , '' Yerkin said . <EOS> `` The Manas Air Base continues to operate under existing agreements , as per the coalition 's efforts in Afghanistan . '' <EOS> U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday the United States will continue to work with Kyrgyzstan on keeping the base open . <EOS> Watch why Kyrgyzstan wants to close the base `` I continue to believe that this is not a closed issue and that there remains the potential at least to reopen this issue with the Kyrgyz and perhaps reach a new agreement , '' Gates said at a NATO meeting in Krakow , Poland . <EOS> `` If we are unable to do that on reasonable terms then , as I have suggested , we are developing alternative methods to get resupply and people into Afghanistan . '' <EOS> The Manas Air Base outside Bishkek is the only U.S. base in Central Asia and is a major resupply hub for the war in Afghanistan . <EOS> Its closing could deal a significant blow to the U.S. military effort there , especially following President Barack Obama 's announcement of additional troops to halt a resurgence of the country 's former Taliban rulers . <EOS> The United States pays $ 17.4 million a year to use Manas , a major logistical and refueling center that supports troops in Afghanistan , the Pentagon said . <EOS> About 15,000 troops and 500 tons of cargo reportedly move through Manas monthly , it said . <EOS> The air base currently employs more than 1,000 servicemen , 95 percent of whom are Americans , Russia 's Interfax news agency reported . <EOS> `` This is an important facility , it has been an important facility , but it 's not irreplaceable and , if necessary , we will find other options , '' Whitman said . <EOS> How far is Manas from Afghanistan ? <EOS> View our map Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , two other Central Asian nations that border Afghanistan , have agreed to allow U.S. cargo to be transported to Afghanistan through their countries , the Russian news agency Interfax reported Friday . <EOS> The agency said Rear Adm. Mark Harnitchek , U.S. transportation command director for strategy , policy , programs and logistics , held a meeting with Tajik Foreign Minister Kharokhon Zarifi , after which he said he had also secured Uzbekistan 's consent . <EOS> A Tajik government statement said only that the two sides discussed the issue , but a spokesman for the Tajik foreign ministry told CNN that `` practically all issues '' to allow U.S. cargo transit through the country have been resolved . <EOS> If confirmed , success would still depend on how much access the United States would have to those countries for flights and cargo , and even then , it may not totally replace the capacity lost in Kyrgyzstan . <EOS> U.S. General David Petraeus , who oversees the war in Afghanistan , was in Uzbekistan this week for talks on Afghanistan and other regional issues . <EOS> A Pentagon spokesman told CNN that his discussions included the regional supply network into Afghanistan . <EOS> The U.S. military leased a base in Uzbekistan after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . <EOS> But after Uzbek troops were accused of killing at least 150 people during a demonstration in 2005 , the autocratic government of President Islam Karimov came under criticism from Washington and severed most of its military ties with the United States .
Four more cases of hantavirus have been reported among people who visited Yosemite National Park in California , bringing the total number of cases to six , the California Department of Public Health said Thursday . <EOS> Two of the six people infected have died . <EOS> The health department is `` working closely with the National Park Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further investigate the cluster of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome cases in Yosemite and reduce the risk of other visitors becoming ill from this virus , '' said Dr. Ron Chapman , health department director . <EOS> Those infected visited the park between early June and mid-July , the health department said . <EOS> Most stayed at the park 's popular Curry Village `` tent cabins . '' <EOS> Yosemite closed the tent cabins indefinitely on Tuesday . <EOS> The park sent letters to around 1,700 summer visitors on Monday and Tuesday , explaining that hantavirus cases had been uncovered and that visitors should see their doctors if symptoms surface , park spokesman Scott Gediman said . <EOS> Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare lung disease that kills about a third of those who get infected . <EOS> Symptoms can include fever , muscle aches and fatigue , though it is not communicable from person to person . <EOS> Yosemite advises medical help for those with hantavirus symptoms `` However , if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue , and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure , together with shortness of breath , -LRB- that -RRB- would be strongly suggestive of HPS , '' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . <EOS> In September 2010 , the Tuolumne Meadows Lodge at Yosemite was assessed for hantavirus risk by the health department and received a rating of `` high risk '' for hantavirus activity . <EOS> The evaluator made a number of recommendations to decrease the risk . <EOS> CNN was unable to determine what , if any , action the park took on the recommendations . <EOS> The lodge is not in the same area of the park as Curry Village . <EOS> In the United States , the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice , cotton rats , rice rats and white-footed mice . <EOS> The virus can be present in the rodents ' urine , droppings and saliva , and it is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus , the CDC says . <EOS> Don Neubacher , Yosemite 's superintendent , said that people typically do n't fall ill with hantavirus until between one and six weeks after they are exposed . <EOS> `` The health of our visitors is our paramount concern , and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness , '' Neubacher said . <EOS> Officials have focused on deer mice , common in the high-elevation eastern Sierra Nevada region . <EOS> The mice are gray or brown on top , with white bellies . <EOS> Their ears have no fur . <EOS> `` Rodents can infest a whole range of these structures , '' said Dr. Vicki Kramer , chief of the health department 's vector-borne disease section . <EOS> `` Deer mice can get in a hole one-quarter inch in diameter . '' <EOS> In addition to cleaning the 400 camp structures , park officials have said they have increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk . <EOS> `` You can not eliminate all the mice , '' Kramer said . <EOS> `` There are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins . '' <EOS> Before this year , Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010 . <EOS> There is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection , according to the CDC , but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care , the better .
The departure of U.S. troops left many questions lingering in Iraq Sunday , analysts told CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' <EOS> `` There are a lot of things here that are not finished . <EOS> There are activities in the region that are still sitting on the edge of potential conflict , '' said retired Gen. James Cartwright , former vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . <EOS> Paul Bremer , a former envoy to Iraq under President George W. Bush , said President Barack Obama had `` placed a very big bet '' by pulling out troops . <EOS> `` The definition of victory actually was given by the president when he made the announcement we were pulling out . <EOS> He said a democratic Iraq can be a model for the region . <EOS> That 's right . <EOS> That 's what President Bush also said . <EOS> And the question is , can a democratic Iraq survive if America pulls out before the job is done ? '' <EOS> he said . <EOS> Another key question , analysts said , is what neighboring Iran will do next . <EOS> `` Iran 's clearly one of the strategic winners out of this . <EOS> The United States managed to eliminate one of the two arch-rivals that Iran faced , and so Iran has gained a much stronger position , '' said Robin Wright , a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson Center . <EOS> `` At the same time , '' she added , `` I think that once the United States withdraws , that the historic tensions between Arabs and Persians along the strategic border are likely to resurface , and that the Iranians will have influence with many of the top leaders in ... Iraq , but it does n't necessarily mean that the Iraqis are going to become the next Iranian province . '' <EOS> The last U.S. troops in Iraq crossed the border into Kuwait Sunday , marking the end of an almost-nine year war . <EOS> According to the defense department , 4,487 service members were killed in the war ; more than 30,000 were wounded . <EOS> It is impossible to know with certainty the number of Iraqis who have died in Iraq since 2003 . <EOS> But the independent public database Iraq Body Count has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and October 2010 , with four out of five dead being civilians . <EOS> Obama said Monday that the end of the Iraq war means a new chapter in U.S.-Iraq relations , with a focus now on a `` normal relationship between sovereign nations . '' <EOS> He told visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that the two nations would build `` a comprehensive partnership '' that includes trade relations , support for building up Iraq 's democratic capacity and military-to-military ties aimed at helping Iraq rebuild its air force , which was destroyed in the war against Saddam Hussein 's regime . <EOS> `` Our goal is simply to make sure Iraq succeeds , '' he said . <EOS> Debate was raging about the nation 's political future Sunday , as a political crisis erupted in Baghdad that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come . <EOS> Iraqiya , a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from Sunni and more secular Iraqis , said it was boycotting parliament , a move that threatens to shatter Iraq 's fragile power-sharing government . <EOS> The political bloc contends that al-Maliki is trying to amass dictatorial power , and many believe that the prime minister was simply waiting for the Americans to leave before making his move . <EOS> `` These old sectarian divides are in many ways deeper than they were even under Saddam Hussein , and the United States can play a certain kind of role in that , '' Wright said , pointing to the importance of diplomatic involvement even after U.S. troops leave . <EOS> Cartwright said U.S. troops may return to Iraq to help train Iraqi forces . <EOS> `` It will be interesting to see , '' he said . <EOS> `` I think the opportunity is there for us to bring forces back in . ''
Governors of several Venezuelan states have warned that recent oil spills and other contamination could be polluting local drinking water . <EOS> But President Hugo Chavez counters that the officials ' criticisms and media reports on the water controversy are propaganda in the political battle against him . <EOS> `` If it is n't war , it is media terrorism . <EOS> This is very serious . <EOS> It is an attack on the physical and mental health of a people , of a community . <EOS> This is a crime , '' Chavez said this week , saying authorities should prosecute those responsible . <EOS> On Thursday , Venezuela 's attorney general said a court had issued an injunction requiring media to `` act with extreme responsibly '' and present evidence when broadcasting information about the country 's water , saying that past reports on contamination were presented without proof in order to cause panic . <EOS> `` They have no technical evidence . <EOS> They are doing it to foster negative opinions , not to help the population . <EOS> If you say something is happening and it is untrue , what can you generate ? <EOS> Conflict and chaos , '' Attorney General Luisa Ortega said . <EOS> Critics say the government should analyze what could be causing drinking water problems , rather than investigating those who have expressed concerns . <EOS> `` There have been a wave of attacks from the national government . <EOS> ... What worries us is not only that they are not recognizing the problem , but that they want to censor the people who denounce it , '' said Edison Duran , general director of the Movement for Water Quality . <EOS> `` The government , unfortunately , treats any denouncement of anything wrong as a political attack , and disqualifies it as a media campaign .

Jose Gregorio Briceno has argued that federal officials are n't being forthcoming about what could be a serious risk to the population . <EOS> The governor has said public health is his primary concern . <EOS> `` I would prefer that the people are healthy , that no one is sick , that no one has cancer or any kind of illness , instead of being irresponsible , '' he told CNN affiliate Globovision . <EOS> Briceno has been at the center of the political and environmental controversy over the water supply since last month , when an oil pipeline ruptured in the Guarapiche River , which runs through his state . <EOS> Federal officials have said Venezuela 's state oil company has cleaned up 95 % of the oil that flowed into the river , and the water in the area is safe to drink . <EOS> But the governor repeatedly expressed concerns over the drinking water supply , and another rupture emerged in public view -- this time within the ranks of Chavez 's United Socialist Party of Venezuela . <EOS> Last week , party leaders expelled Briceno `` for willing , serious offenses derived from unethical and counter-revolutionary positions , '' state media reported . <EOS> Two opposition governors in other states have also expressed concerns about water in recent weeks . <EOS> `` We call on the national government to declare an emergency in the whole water system because ... there is no guarantee that the water going to the homes in the center of the country is drinkable , '' said Henrique Salas Feo , governor of Carabobo state , alleging that drinking water from a reservoir was contaminated . <EOS> In Zulia state , Gov. Pablo Perez said an oil spill in neighboring Colombia had contaminated a lake . <EOS> But Chavez maintained that the officials ' concerns and media reports have no credibility . <EOS> `` It 's a disgrace . <EOS> It is a great lie , '' he said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The official tally of last month 's presidential election is almost complete , and one pivotal piece of electoral data -- voter turnout -- will be lower than officials have previously claimed . <EOS> The turnout matters as it may reflect how much trust the Hondurans placed in an election during a political crisis pitting the country 's de facto government against the nation 's ousted president . <EOS> According to Honduras ' Supreme Electoral Tribunal and interviews with the electoral officials , with 99.8 percent of the votes counted , 2,298,080 people participated in the November 29 election . <EOS> This represents a 50 percent voter turnout , a figure much lower than the 61 percent officially estimated by the electoral tribunal on election day , and lower than revised turnout figures that the Electoral Tribunal gave to CNN as recently as December 5 . <EOS> The crisis , which escalated after President Jose Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a coup last June , has split the international community now that a new president has been elected . <EOS> Some countries , such as the United States , Colombia and Costa Rica , have said they will recognize President-elect Lobo Sosa . <EOS> Others , such as Argentina , Brazil and Spain , have said they will not . <EOS> Other nations have indicated that the turnout figure will be an important indicator in determining whether they will recognize the legitimacy of the election . <EOS> To date , the tribunal , known as TSE by its Spanish acronym , has only released one official press release regarding the vote count . <EOS> That statement , made on election day , cites a 61 percent voter turnout rate and says 2.8 million people cast votes . <EOS> When CNN made its own analysis earlier this month , TSE spokesman Roberto Reyes Pineda said that about 2.6 million votes were cast . <EOS> This downward revision turned out to be overly optimistic as well . <EOS> `` There was clearly an effort to get out early vote results as robustly as possibly and convince the international community that the elections were legitimate , '' Christopher Sabatini , senior director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas , told CNN . <EOS> But Reyes Pineda said that the electoral tribunal has not purposefully tried to put out inflated numbers . <EOS> `` That was a projection that reflected the data at the moment , '' he said , referring to the data in the first press release and the data given to CNN . <EOS> A consultant to the TSE who has participated on the official vote count disagreed . <EOS> `` They gave out those numbers without any substantive evidence , '' said the consultant , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was fearful of jeopardizing his position . <EOS> `` There was no substantive methodology behind their projections . '' <EOS> Estimates from TSE were higher than the patterns the statisticians were seeing because there was political pressure for the election to be considered legitimate and successful , the consultant said . <EOS> Reyes Pineda said that the TSE 's estimates of 2.8 million and 2.6 million votes cast were `` based on what we expected . <EOS> The number could be a little erroneous , but it was based on the data at the time . '' <EOS> The electoral body has n't put out any further updates to its original 61 percent voter turnout prediction to avoid confusion , he said . <EOS> Another official press release is not expected until after all the votes are tabulated and all disputes in smaller races settled , Reyes Pineda said . <EOS> A 50 percent turnout would mean that fewer voters participated than in the last presidential race , in 2005 , where turnout was 55 percent , according to TSE data . <EOS> But it also follows a trend of declining turnout since 1997 . <EOS> `` Even the adjusted numbers are not significantly different from the patterns of past elections , '' Sabatini said . <EOS> A turnout of under 40 percent may have jeopardized the international acceptance of the election , but the actual turnout rate is still significant enough to be considered legitimate , he said . <EOS> Other indicators that could shed light on whether Zelaya 's calls for a boycott were heeded , such as the number of spoiled or blank ballots , are not significantly different than in the last election , TSE data shows .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While President-elect Barack Obama will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on January 20 , he 'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used during the inauguration of 1861 . <EOS> The 1861 Lincoln Inaugural Bible against the backdrop of the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress . <EOS> The Constitution does not require presidents to be sworn in on a Bible , though almost every chief executive since George Washington has chosen to do so . <EOS> Presidents have differed greatly , however , on the question of which passage the Bible should be opened to during the swearing-in ceremony . <EOS> It brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage Obama will emphasize . <EOS> If what is past is prologue , as Shakespeare famously wrote -LRB- a quote now engraved in front of the National Archives -RRB- , he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance . <EOS> According to Gleaves Whitney , a presidential historian at Michigan 's Grand Valley State University , II Chronicles 7:14 was used for three swearing-in ceremonies : `` If my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land . '' <EOS> In this season of economic distress , however , the president-elect may prefer to follow the lead of Franklin Roosevelt . <EOS> When FDR first took the oath of office in 1933 , the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the Great Depression . <EOS> `` Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment , '' Roosevelt said in his inaugural address . <EOS> Urging his fellow Americans to lend a helping hand , Roosevelt had the Bible opened to I Corinthians 13 : `` And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity . '' <EOS> Obama campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation 's bitter partisan divide . <EOS> `` We have never been a collection of red states and blue states , '' Obama said in his Election Night victory speech . <EOS> `` We are , and always will be , the United States of America . '' <EOS> If Obama wants to stress that theme again on January 20 , he may prefer to follow Bill Clinton 's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the Bible to Isaiah 58:12 : `` Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach . '' <EOS> Questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president 's mind . <EOS> Obama campaigned in part on a promise to end America 's war in Iraq . <EOS> Shortly after winning the White House on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in Vietnam -- Richard Nixon took the oath with a family Bible opened to Isaiah 2:4 : `` And he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : Nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more . '' <EOS> With the polls showing an overwhelming majority of Americans convinced the country is on the wrong track , Obama might hint at a back-to-basics message by doing what Woodrow Wilson did in 1913 . <EOS> During his first inaugural , Wilson opened the Bible to Psalm 119 , which concludes `` I have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for I do not forget thy commandments . '' <EOS> Speaking of a return to basics , what about America 's first president ? <EOS> What did George Washington do ? <EOS> Almost 220 years ago , in 1789 , Washington opened the King James version of a Masonic Bible to Genesis 49:13 -- `` Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto Zidon . '' <EOS> Was America 's first president trying to send a deep , profound message ? <EOS> Not exactly . <EOS> It turns out that , for the nation 's first inaugural , the Bible was hastily opened to a completely random page . <EOS> The same thing was done 72 years later when Lincoln was sworn in . <EOS> CNN 's Brendan Polmer contributed to this report .
Authorities arrested at least nine people after a `` series of fights '' at the nation 's biggest shopping mall sent chairs flying and caused after-Christmas shoppers to flee , officials in Minnesota said Tuesday . <EOS> Police and security officers at the Mall of America arrested a mix of young adults and juveniles after a food-court fight around 4 p.m. Monday broke up into brawls elsewhere in the shopping center , Bloomington Police Department Commander Mark Stehlik said . <EOS> At one point , police received reports of up to 10 separate fights , he said . <EOS> Video of one incident showed a man picking up a chair to throw as crowds of shoppers , some screaming , fled a mall food court . <EOS> The video also showed a group of what appeared to be youths brawling before police officers intervened . <EOS> Witnesses described a chaotic scene . <EOS> `` There were drinks thrown on the floor and chairs being thrown everywhere , '' witness Tess Dessalgne told television station KARE . <EOS> She reported that `` everyone started running toward the fight , '' while the video showed others leaving the area . <EOS> Another woman told CNN affiliate WCCO that she `` did n't really know what was going on '' when stores unexpectedly began closing down but soon saw police `` pushing us all away from Nordstrom -LRB- department store -RRB- . '' <EOS> `` Unfortunately , as we have witnessed at shopping sites across the country this week , large groups of individuals can come together and create bad situations , '' mall officials said in a statement . <EOS> `` It is very unfortunate to see these incidents occurring , especially during the holiday shopping season when families are out spending time together . '' <EOS> No serious injuries were reported , the statement said . <EOS> The mall remained open , although some stores closed down temporarily . <EOS> Some witnesses told WCCO the fights began after reports that rappers Lil ' Wayne and Drake were visiting the mall . <EOS> `` I 've heard that and some other things as far as speculation . <EOS> I do n't know that there 's anything to substantiate that , '' Stehlik said . <EOS> Investigators are still working to determine what caused the fight , he said . <EOS> `` Frankly , at this time , we do n't really have any idea , and we might never . <EOS> It 's hard to say what starts a fight , '' he said . <EOS> The mall responded to a query on Twitter by saying , `` Drake is not here . '' <EOS> `` There was no shooting , '' the mall tweeted to one person . <EOS> `` Chairs were thrown in the food court resulting in the loud noise you heard . '' <EOS> At one point , more than 30 officers were trying to calm the crowd , Stehlik said . <EOS> He described the series of fights as a `` highly unusual event . '' <EOS> `` We kind of pushed people out toward one of the exit doors and out of the mall in an attempt to quell the crowd a little bit , '' he said . <EOS> `` Once we got everybody out , the whole thing kind of just settled down and went back to business as usual . '' <EOS> The Mall of America describes itself as the largest retail and entertainment complex in the United States . <EOS> It says it has more than 520 stores , 50 restaurants and attractions that include an aquarium , flight simulator and a spa for children .
Roger Federer handed his fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka a tough three-set loss in the semifinals of the World Tour Finals on Saturday . <EOS> But it turns out the nearly three-hour epic also took something out of the 33-year-old . <EOS> Federer pulled out of the final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday , marking just the third time in his career he gave his opponent a walkover . <EOS> Federer went on court in a track suit to tell the crowd he was n't match fit and later on Facebook revealed he hurt his back `` late in the match yesterday . '' <EOS> He disclosed in a subsequent interview with the ATP it happened in the third-set tiebreaker of his late-night 4-6 7-5 7-6 -LRB- 6 -RRB- victory over Wawrinka . <EOS> `` I felt all of a sudden the back was feeling funny , '' Federer told the ATP . <EOS> `` I tried to have treatment on it , medication on it , just tried to turn around as quick as possible really , but did n't really feel that much of an improvement overnight . '' <EOS> Federer was plagued by back issues in 2013 , largely contributing to a subpar -- for him -- campaign . <EOS> He had been in good health in 2014 , though , one of the reasons the 17-time grand slam champion was able to climb the rankings and finish at No. 2 . <EOS> `` I tried all year to be ready for the ATP World Tour Finals , and I did n't want it to end this way , '' Federer stated to the crowd . <EOS> `` It would be too risky at my age to do this right now and I hope you understand . <EOS> `` I wanted to come out personally and excuse myself . <EOS> It 's been a great week for me . <EOS> I played some great tennis and I love coming to the O2 and to London , and there 's been so many great memories for me here . '' <EOS> Djokovic thus becomes the first men 's player since Ivan Lendl in 1987 to claim three consecutive year-end titles and his 31-match winning streak indoors remains intact . <EOS> He learned of Federer 's withdrawal during the doubles final , which was scheduled 2 1/2 hours before the singles final . <EOS> `` It 's a very awkward situation to talk about , '' Djokovic told reporters . <EOS> `` You never like to win , especially these big matches against big rivals , with a -LRB- walkover -RRB- . '' <EOS> World No. 1 Djokovic stuck around to play an exhibition set against Andy Murray and that was followed by a doubles tussle featuring Murray and John McEnroe against Tim Henman and Pat Cash . <EOS> As big a blow as it was for Federer not to play , questions will now center around his fitness for the Davis Cup final against France in Lille that starts on Friday . <EOS> Indeed the Swiss team might be out of sorts come the final , since the Federer-Wawrinka encounter Saturday -- when Federer saved four match points -- became ill-tempered at times . <EOS> Wawrinka crunched a backhand at Federer when the latter was at the net and also , at one stage , Wawrinka jawed at the Federer camp , seemingly unhappy with something that was said to him . <EOS> The Davis Cup is one of the lone huge titles Federer has not won . <EOS> `` Recovery obviously as quick as possible , and then traveling to France at some point and getting ready on the clay for the Davis Cup final , '' Federer said of his immediate plans . <EOS> Sunday 's dramatic events brought an end to a tournament plagued by lopsided results in singles . <EOS> Only four of the 14 singles matches extended to three sets . <EOS> `` But this is something you can not predict , '' said Djokovic , who handed out chocolates to journalists just as he did after winning last year 's event . <EOS> The doubles competition featured plenty of excitement , including in the final when Americans Bob and Mike Bryan beat Croatia 's Ivan Dodig and Brazil 's Marcelo Melo 6-7 -LRB- 5 -RRB- 6-2 10-7 .
Casey Kasem 's children are being prevented from visiting their ailing father , his daughter Kerri told CNN . <EOS> Casey Kasem , known for his years hosting the countdown shows `` American Top 40 '' and `` Casey 's Top 40 , '' is suffering from Parkinson 's disease . <EOS> He 's 81 and retired from his radio hosting in 2009 . <EOS> According to Kerri Kasem , about three months ago , her stepmother , Jean Kasem , suddenly barred her sister , her uncle and some of Kasem 's friends from seeing him . <EOS> She 's perplexed by the decision . <EOS> `` I do n't get it , I do n't understand it , '' Kerri Kasem , who co-hosts the radio show `` Sixx Sense '' with Motley Crue 's Nikki Sixx , told CNN . <EOS> `` He has Parkinson 's and all the research we 've done indicates socialization would help him . '' <EOS> CNN has reached out in an attempt to get a statement from Jean Kasem , but has so far been unsuccessful . <EOS> Los Angeles TV station KABC reported that Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem 's Holmby Hills house on Tuesday . <EOS> `` He ca n't really speak , but he knows we 're there , '' she told the station . <EOS> `` And last time we saw him , he could shuffle a little bit . <EOS> He had a hard , very hard , time walking . <EOS> He was just deteriorating due to Parkinson 's disease . '' <EOS> `` We fear that he 's been isolated and neglected , and so that 's why we stand here today , '' said Gonzalo Venecia , Casey 's former personal assistant . <EOS> Asked about accusations that her family was trying to become beneficiaries of Kasem 's will , Kerri Kasem told CNN that was n't the case . <EOS> `` My dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will , and we 're OK with that . <EOS> We 've known that for years , '' she said . <EOS> `` I 've never asked him for anything , nor have I asked Jean for anything . '' <EOS> Don Pitts , Kasem 's agent of more than 35 years , said he did not want to take sides in the argument , but he did say Casey is still of sound mind at age 81 . <EOS> `` He has Parkinson 's , has it very bad . <EOS> It took his speech , and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift , that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating . <EOS> But he 's handling it very well , '' Pitts said . <EOS> `` His mind is very sharp , his brain works well . <EOS> You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you 're saying . <EOS> He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somber and brow beaten , Kolubah piles potato greens on top of his head and walks to the nearest market at 5am . <EOS> Barefoot . <EOS> He has to sell all of his greens to make money so his family can eat . <EOS> His parents and siblings are unable to provide for themselves , so everyday Kolubah is forced to skip school and earn a living . <EOS> His only solace : football . <EOS> Later that same day Coach Tio kneels down to tie Kolubah 's shoelaces . <EOS> Kolubah is 10-years-old and the breadwinner for his family . <EOS> But so rarely does he wear shoes , he does n't even know how to tie his own laces . <EOS> Tough childhoods Tough childhoods are not uncommon in Liberia , West Africa . <EOS> In January , I was there with a documentary team shooting an episode of `` The World Cup Project '' -- a documentary TV show featuring 11 countries and 11 organizations around the world that are using football for social change and development in the build up to this year 's tournament . <EOS> We found a country still recovering from a civil war that ended a decade ago , and resulted in around 250,000 people dying and thousands more being displaced . <EOS> During the conflict , children as young as eight were handed machetes and machine guns and told to massacre their families . <EOS> Child soldiers were the weapon of choice in this brutal war and the scars are still very raw . <EOS> But there is a glowing red sunset at the end of this story as an heroic organization of local football coaches is changing the face of Liberia . <EOS> One football game at a time . <EOS> The woman behind this organization -- LACES , Life and Change Experienced Thru Sport -- is Seren Fryatt , 34 , from Muncie , Indiana . <EOS> After she spent several months volunteering on board a floating hospital ship in Liberia , and playing for Liberia 's Professional Women 's Soccer Division , LACES was born . <EOS> Fryatt dreamed of promoting social change and development through her favorite sport -- football -- and her dream became a reality in 2007 when LACES set up its first program in Liberia . <EOS> LACES ' mission is simple : `` To develop positive role models in communities in a manner that is fun and challenging . '' <EOS> LACES currently has three programs in Liberia in Kona , Cotton Tree and Duport Road and has worked with 80 coaches and 700 kids . <EOS> It is a faith-based organization and recruits its coaches from local churches , they then attend a workshop on coaching and mentor training and are given equipment to register children ages 10-14 . <EOS> According to Fryatt , `` this age group was chosen because it is within this range that children are in the formative stages of learning and comprehension of personal decision making . <EOS> As well as mentoring the children and training the coaches , LACES also has a feeding program . <EOS> Weekly , after each game , the kids are provided with a free meal to enjoy with their coach . <EOS> Sometimes this is the only meal the children get on this day . <EOS> Before the end of the year LACES plans to roll out a new `` Kick Out Corruption '' campaign to tackle the problem of corruption in Liberia . <EOS> `` It 's vital the children of the future know their rights , and know what is right and wrong when it comes to corruption , '' Fryatt claims . <EOS> `` Unfortunately corruption is a very real everyday problem here and we want to try and address that . '' <EOS> Many of the Laces coaches themselves grew up during the civil war . <EOS> They are now teaching children social skills through football , ensuring the children of this generation do not become new victims of the conflict they lived through . <EOS> And through their work the coaches are coming to terms with their own pasts , their own losses and sometimes their own brutal actions . <EOS> Horrific memories LACES ' national director , James Moore , was brutally attacked and stabbed in his own home in Monrovia recently as his children slept in the next room . <EOS> He reveals : `` It brought back horrific memories of the war . <EOS> The war may be over but the scars still remain . '' <EOS> Some of his memories are truly terrifying . <EOS> James says that at just 13 years old he walked for four days with his 80-year-old grandmother , through the jungle , to a neighboring village for safety . <EOS> He went to fetch food for his family and heard a ruckus . <EOS> As any curious teenager would , James went towards the noise . <EOS> But he wishes to this day that he had not . <EOS> He watched as a man executed another man , ripped his heart out of his chest and ate it . <EOS> `` It is the worst thing I have ever seen and causes me nightmares to this day , '' James admits . <EOS> Pastor Louis Roberts , Mentoring Manager of LACES , has his own harrowing tales to tell . <EOS> He lost his entire family under Charles Taylor 's regime . <EOS> His mother , his father , his brothers and sisters all died , leaving him to fend for himself . <EOS> But instead of picking up a gun , Pastor Roberts found the church and LACES and is determined to educate the children so Liberia never sees another Civil War . <EOS> `` The children are the future of this country , '' he says . <EOS> `` It is my job to make sure they learn basic social skills like respect for their families , their team mates and their coaches . <EOS> These skills are what LACES is all about . <EOS> We teach the kids how to have fun , but also how to be better people . <EOS> On and off the pitch .

Do you prefer to get a text message or a phone call if someone wants to reach you on your cell phone ? <EOS> According to a new study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project , 31 % of American adults prefer text messages to phone calls . <EOS> An additional 14 % said the contact method they prefer depends on the situation . <EOS> To put this in perspective , most Americans -LRB- but just barely : 53 % -RRB- still generally prefer to get voice calls rather than text messages . <EOS> Also , Pew notes that 4 % of cell owners do not make or receive any voice calls on an average day . <EOS> And 27 % of cell owners do not use text messaging , even occasionally . <EOS> Not surprisingly , younger adults are especially likely to use texting . <EOS> According to Pew , `` Cell owners between the ages of 18 and 24 exchange an average of 109.5 messages on a normal day -- more than 3,200 texts per month . <EOS> And the typical or median cell owner in this age group sends or receives 50 messages per day -LRB- or 1500 messages per month -RRB- . '' <EOS> Also , the rate of texting for 18 - to 24-year-olds is `` more than double the comparable figure for 25-34 year olds , and 23 times the figure for text messaging users who are 65 or older . '' <EOS> Whether individuals prefer to get text messages rather than voice calls appears to have a large correlation with how heavily they use text messaging . <EOS> For instance , 55 % of people who send or receive more than 51 texts per day report preferring them to phone calls . <EOS> However , since younger adults are most likely to be heavy texters , this preference does indirectly correlate with age . <EOS> Why some prefer texting Why do some people prefer texting to voice calls ? <EOS> Pew did not speculate on this , but How Stuff Works suggests some relative advantages of texting . <EOS> First , privacy : it 's far less likely that an SMS conversation can be overheard . <EOS> -LRB- Conversely , this can also be a matter of courtesy ; do n't you wish more people in public settings would use text messaging rather than voice calls , if they must communicate with someone right that minute ? -RRB- <EOS> Also , text messaging provides greater accessibility , not just for people with hearing impairments but also to compensate for ambient noise , weak or spotty cell network connections , or the poor quality of microphones and speakers that plague many cell phones . <EOS> But perhaps the main reasons why many people prefer getting text messages over voice calls are related to time . <EOS> Typically , text messaging encourages briefer , more efficient exchanges of information . <EOS> Even `` social grooming '' chitchat often gets abbreviated so it 's quicker to type and read -- although in the context of texting culture , this is n't necessarily viewed as colder or less socially or emotionally significant . <EOS> Similarly , there 's less psychological or social pressure to respond immediately to texts . <EOS> So you can take a moment to finish a task at hand -LRB- such as parking your car -RRB- or to consider what you want to say before responding to a text message . <EOS> Text messaging also can reduce the discomfort or impatience some people experience with pauses in real-time voice conversations -- or the chance that they may instantly blurt a response that they 'd later regret . <EOS> A text-messaging decline ? <EOS> If today 's young adults ' taste for text messaging persists as they age , this could spell big changes for how wireless carriers do business in the future . <EOS> Pew notes that voice calls and texting -- the two main services conducted over cell phone carriers ' basic networks , rather than their data networks , for which they typically charge extra -- appear to have plateaued in the U.S. `` Both text messaging and phone calling on cell phones have leveled off for the adult population as a whole , '' said the report . <EOS> `` Text messaging users send or receive an average of 41.5 messages on a typical day , with the median user sending or receiving 10 texts daily -- both figures are largely unchanged from what we reported in 2010 . <EOS> Similarly , cell owners make or receive an average of 12 calls on their cells per day , which is unchanged from 2010 . '' <EOS> A plateau -- or even an eventual decline -- in the popularity of both voice calls and text messages could profoundly change how carriers charge for voice calls and text messaging in coming years . <EOS> In the long term , this might even lead some wireless carriers to abandon the direct telephony business or to treat it as a specialized service . <EOS> Right now , voice calling and text messaging packages are primary revenue sources for wireless carriers . <EOS> These services are provided to virtually every cell phone , including the 65 % of U.S. mobile phones that are not smartphones and so do n't necessarily include data plans at this time . <EOS> Internet calling But there are many options for placing voice calls over the Internet -LRB- Skype , Google Voice , Vonage and more -RRB- using voice over Internet protocol -LRB- VOIP -RRB- technology . <EOS> These services generally are not tied to a particular device , so you can access your VOIP account from your computer , tablet or phone -- or even a shared device . <EOS> VOIP calling systems tend to be more complex for consumers to set up , learn and use than simply dialing a phone number to make a regular phone call . <EOS> They also can be quirkier or less reliable than standard phone calls . <EOS> But in coming years , these services probably will become more user-friendly for typical non-tech-savvy U.S. consumers . <EOS> Meanwhile , more U.S. consumers are buying smartphones that can run apps for VOIP calling services . <EOS> By late 2012 or early 2013 , over half of the cell phones in use in the U.S. will probably be smartphones . <EOS> Also , many of the remaining feature phones on the U.S. market are becoming considerably `` smarter , '' with greater capabilities to handle more advanced internet-based services -- perhaps even VOIP calling . <EOS> SMS text messaging also has ample competition from the various popular Internet-based instant messaging services such as AOL IM , Yahoo Messenger , Google Talk and more . <EOS> BlackBerry Messenger is another SMS alternative popular users of BlackBerry phones . <EOS> But the catch with alternative instant messaging services is that each one is a closed system . <EOS> For instance , you ca n't directly send an instant message to BlackBerry Messenger from Google Talk . <EOS> While instant messaging remains such a fragmented communication landscape , SMS -LRB- which bridges all phone types and carrier networks -RRB- retains a significant advantage . <EOS> You can use that one mobile tool to communicate with whoever you want , as long as you have their cell phone number , and they do n't need to be logged in to a site or service at that time to receive your message . <EOS> Confusion for users Still , Pew 's research hints that the standard U.S. wireless telephony market might be starting a long-term decline . <EOS> It 's conceivable that U.S. wireless carriers may eventually shift to mainly selling data , rather than telephony . <EOS> This could mean that someday , standard cell phone calls and text messages might be sold as special add-on services , perhaps handled by separate divisions or companies for extra fees . <EOS> What might that mean for mobile phone users ? <EOS> Probably a lot more confusion and frustration while the shift sorts out . <EOS> It would take a few years at least before a communication system based mostly on the Internet and wireless data becomes as coherent and simple as the national telephone system most Americans grew up with . <EOS> Consumers may eventually see cost savings or service improvements associated with more freedom to choose how they make voice calls or send text messages , but this probably would n't be an easy change for most people to make . <EOS> The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran .
Grozny , Chechnya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It has been ten years since my last visit to Chechnya . <EOS> I knew the place had changed . <EOS> I did n't realize how much . <EOS> For a decade , Chechnya was the most violent , hopeless , war-torn corner of Russia . <EOS> Russia 's impoverished , conscript army had been locked in an ugly struggle with Chechen insurgents that left the region 's capital , Grozny , a smoking ruin . <EOS> Much of the civilian population was either homeless or had fled . <EOS> Meanwhile , even the most courageous reporters and human rights activists thought twice about sneaking into the republic . <EOS> By the end of the 1990s , Chechen gangs made a lucrative business out of kidnapping and ransom . <EOS> The kidnappers became quite adept at chopping off hostage body parts on camera , to provide gruesome video incentive for swift payment . <EOS> Imagine my surprise , then , when Russian government minders pick us up at Chechnya 's newly-constructed airport , and then send a busload of foreign journalists to sparkling downtown Grozny without any armed escort . <EOS> A decade ago , the only illumination in Grozny would have come from tracer bullets and the campfires of traumatized residents whose homes had been destroyed . <EOS> Today , a giant , Turkish-built mosque glows at the center of a park rigged with rows of retro-style street lamps . <EOS> Families wander around on sidewalks in the balmy air . <EOS> There is not a single gunman or soldier in sight . <EOS> For the next two days of this Kremlin-supervised junket , I strain to find signs of the bullet-holes and shrapnel scars that once seemed to pock-mark every piece of concrete in Chechnya . <EOS> Instead , in Chechnya 's second largest city of Gudermes , I find armies of workers -- including migrant laborers from East Asia -- busily constructing high-rises and roads . <EOS> Downtown Gudermes is getting an architectural face-lift . <EOS> Ten years ago , when I wandered off from a Russian military `` embed '' trip to Gudermes , Chechen locals joked openly about how much I would be worth if they kidnapped me , prompting me to hustle back to my army escort . <EOS> Today , residents sing a very different tune . <EOS> `` We thought it would take 50 years to rebuild this town , '' one Chechen man wearing in a wide-brimmed black hat tells me . <EOS> `` It 's a miracle how quickly this has happened here ! '' <EOS> The Kremlin clearly spent untold billions of rubles rebuilding the most unruly of Russian republics . <EOS> It also struck a deal several years ago with a brash former rebel fighter named Ramzan Kadyrov . <EOS> His Chechen security forces began taking the lead in operations against the insurgents . <EOS> Today , Kadyrov is the president of the Chechen republic . <EOS> This fiercely loyal supporter of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has adopted the bizarre habits one comes to expect from a Middle Eastern despot . <EOS> Kadyrov races around his fiefdom driving his own black SUV , dressed in shiny track suits and baseball caps . <EOS> His mansion , a half hour 's drive out of Grozny , has its own horse race track , a show room full of antique guns and sabers , the Cyrillic initials `` RK '' carved into the building 's faade and a private zoo full of lions , tigers and other big , endangered wildcats . <EOS> The roars of one of these animals echoes throughout the compound as we wait until well after midnight for a press conference with the Chechen strongman . <EOS> When Kadyrov finally arrives , he makes an announcement of victory . <EOS> `` We are in the final stages of our struggle , '' he says , and then goes on to claim there are only 187 fighters left in Chechnya 's insurgent movement . <EOS> Most of them , he adds , are foreigners . <EOS> But peace in Chechnya has come at a disturbing price . <EOS> For some reason , critics of Kadyrov and his security forces keep getting killed . <EOS> Last July , Natalia Estemirova , an activist with the human rights group Memorial , was kidnapped in broad daylight in downtown Grozny and later found dead with two bullets to the head . <EOS> `` This crime could n't have been committed without the participation of some law enforcement agencies , '' says Dokka Itslaev , the Chechen man who has assumed Estemirova 's former position at Memorial . <EOS> `` Certain forces in Chechnya reserve the right to kidnap , kill or torture whoever they want . '' <EOS> More recently , police in Austria linked one of Kadyrov 's top aides to the January 2009 shooting death in Vienna of Umar Israilov . <EOS> The former Chechen rebel served in Kadyrov 's security forces and later testified against Kadyrov before the European Court of Human Rights . <EOS> Moments after his murder , Austrian police said one of the suspects called a cell phone in Chechnya believed to belong to one of Kadyrov 's right-hand men , Shaa Turlayev . <EOS> Turlayev visited Vienna and met with the suspect a few months before the murder . <EOS> Kadyrov denied any links to the murder , while delivering a lengthy monologue . <EOS> `` I knew this guy -LSB- Umar Israilov -RSB- personally , '' he said during the midnight press conference . <EOS> `` It would have been so stupid and so obvious to kill people in broad daylight . <EOS> Why would I do this ? <EOS> Did he kill any of my people ? <EOS> If he did , maybe then I would have considered it . '' <EOS> The Kremlin now relies on Kadyrov , along with the many potentially explosive skeletons in his closet , to guarantee peace and stability in Chechnya . <EOS> But while Chechnya has stabilized , the neighboring Russian regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia have grown more violent then ever , with frequent car bombs and assassinations . <EOS> Caucasus experts say the Chechen nationalist movement that once challenged Moscow has morphed into a broader Islamist rebel movement that threatens to engulf the Russian North Caucasus . <EOS> That violence seems worlds ' away from the brand-new ice skating rink that we visit in Grozny one night . <EOS> Dance music throbs as young Chechen men on ice skates crash into each other , laughing ; some of them hug the sideboards to avoid collapsing on the ice . <EOS> It is a silly , wonderful sight to see in a city that had endured so many years of war and hopelessness . <EOS> But how long can Kadyrov 's huge public works projects and scary security forces ensure stability , with so much trouble brewing nextdoor and unemployment still sky high within Chechnya ? <EOS> The clich that Chechnya is `` skating on thin ice , '' springs to mind -- especially after I notice that one of the Chechen men , teetering comically on the ice , is skating with a pistol strapped to his belt .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Vonderrit Deondre Myers , a teenager who died in a police shooting , was struck by seven or eight bullets , St. Louis city Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham said Thursday night . <EOS> `` All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities , '' Graham said . <EOS> `` The one fatal wound was to the head . '' <EOS> Police Chief Sam Dotson said the killing happened Wednesday evening when a suspect shot a pistol three times at the St. Louis officer , who was off-duty but wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company . <EOS> The officer fired his pistol 17 times , police said . <EOS> The shooting sparked angry street protests , with residents pointing out similarities to the August killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson . <EOS> Myers and Brown were both 18 and black and killed by white police officers . <EOS> One big difference : Police said Brown was not armed . <EOS> `` It ` s a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty , '' Akbar Muhammad , part of a coalition seeking justice in the Brown shooting , told CNN affiliate KTVI . <EOS> `` He chased them off a corner . '' <EOS> Were 17 shots excessive ? <EOS> St. Louis Police Officers ' Association lawyer Neil Bruntrager discussed that Thursday night on `` Erin Burnett OutFront . '' <EOS> `` When he uses deadly force he uses deadly force until the threat is gone , '' Bruntrager said . <EOS> Bruntrager said without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses , the police and the public must rely on physical evidence . <EOS> A 9mm pistol allegedly fired by Myers was found at the scene , police said . <EOS> But Van Jones , a civil rights activist and CNN contributor , said nobody can trust the police after the Brown killing . <EOS> `` You 're seeing a wholesale breakdown of trust , '' he said on `` OutFront . '' <EOS> Thursday night , St. Louis residents held a candlelight vigil for Myers at a sandwich shop where he bought food shortly before being shot . <EOS> They sang hymns , prayed and released balloons into the air . <EOS> Speakers urged the people to remain peaceful . <EOS> `` The chief did an outstanding job yesterday , keeping the tension down between the police officers , as well the protesters , '' Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed of St. Louis said to KTVI . <EOS> `` It is an unfortunate situation . <EOS> My heart goes out to the family , but again from what I am hearing it was a direct correlation to racial profiling , racial profiling went deadly . '' <EOS> The Myers shooting occurred just ahead of a `` Weekend of Resistance '' in St. Louis , where activists will push for movement in the investigation into the Brown case . <EOS> Tensions are already high in the community , and it 's uncertain how the latest shooting will affect its mood . <EOS> An animated crowd quickly gathered late Wednesday near the shooting site close to the Missouri Botanical Garden , chanting slogans as St. Louis police officers stood by . <EOS> `` Hey , hey , ho , ho , these killer cops have got to go , '' the crowd chanted , repurposing a popular chant from the Brown protests . <EOS> The confrontations with police were intense and laced with profanity . <EOS> `` That was somebody 's baby , '' screamed one man , referring to the man who was killed . <EOS> `` Think about your own child , '' pleaded another person in the crowd . <EOS> Despite the tensions , Dotson said no businesses were looted and no windows were smashed . <EOS> He praised officers for showing a `` tremendous amount of restraint '' as members of the crowd confronted them face-to-face and damaged three police cruisers . <EOS> CNN affiliate KMOV reported that a post office was damaged . <EOS> Complete coverage of Ferguson The officer , a six-year veteran who has not been named , was placed on administrative leave . <EOS> Bruntager said he served two tours of duty with the military in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart . <EOS> While on patrol , the officer saw three black males run away as he approached , Dotson said . <EOS> He gave chase because one of them was holding up his pants in a way that made the officer believe the teen may be carrying a gun , Dotson said . <EOS> The officer and one of the three tussled . <EOS> The teen ran off , then turned around and fired at least three shots at the officer , Dotson said . <EOS> The officer returned fire , killing the teen . <EOS> Online court documents show Myers was arrested June 27 and charged with unlawful use of a weapon , a felony , and resisting arrest . <EOS> He 'd been released on bond . <EOS> A hearing scheduled for Monday had been postponed , with the next hearing on November 17 , the documents show . <EOS> The two other males have not been apprehended . <EOS> A man describing himself as the owner of Regal Foods in St. Louis , but who did n't want to give his name , told CNN in a phone interview that Myers was in his store before the shooting . <EOS> Myers was wearing a T-shirt , the store owner said , adding that he did n't see a gun . <EOS> The teen bought a sandwich and left . <EOS> He was shot across the street from the store about 10 minutes later , he said . <EOS> Myers ' cousin , Latara Franks , said another cousin , her brother and a family friend were with Myers , and they confirmed to her he purchased a sandwich at a corner store shortly before the shooting . <EOS> `` He got in trouble with police , but he went to school and work , '' Franks said of Myers . <EOS> `` I ca n't believe they did him like this .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The second cut in U.S. interest rates in as many weeks is putting further pressure on the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to reconsider their currencies ' peg with the dollar ; and none more so than Qatar . <EOS> Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad tells MME Qatar has not made any decisions regarding dropping the dollar-peg . <EOS> The small emirate has the highest inflation rate in the region , and it threatens to spiral further northward as its government brings Qatari interest rates into line with the U.S. . <EOS> The Qatar Central Bank lopped half a percentage off its deposit rate after the Federal Reserve sought to stave off recession in the U.S. with an emergency cut of 75 percentage points on January 22 . <EOS> Eight days later , the Fed moved again , this time with a cut of half a percentage point to take U.S. interest rates to three percent . <EOS> After the first cut , MME 's John Defterios sat down for an exclusive television interview with Qatar 's Prime Minister , Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani , who is also the emirate 's Foreign Minister , and controls Qatar 's sovereign wealth fund through the Qatar Investment Authority -LRB- QIA -RRB- . <EOS> John Defterios started by asking Sheikh Hamad whether the sharp decline in U.S. interest rates was putting too much pressure on Qatar 's dollar-peg . <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : Oil and gas are saleable in dollars , but most of our imports are not in dollars but in Euros or Asian currencies . <EOS> All of these currencies went 40 percent to 50 percent above the level which we experienced two years ago . <EOS> For us , there is a pressure . <EOS> We know that a decision needs to be made by the Fed because of the situation on the stock market in the United States ; it might be a wise decision . <EOS> But for countries like the GCC and Qatar , especially Qatar , it puts us under pressure on how to deal with inflation and our currency , which is undervalued already by at least 35 percent . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : What is your instinct telling you , to go to a basket of currencies to buffer this fall of the dollar ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : We are studying all options at the moment , but what I can say is that at the GCC meetings in December the agreement was to hold onto the dollar and to see . <EOS> Every country has to see its way out of this , but only after a consultation with the GCC . <EOS> For us , our wish is that it 's a policy to be taken by the whole GCC , to either basket or revalue our currency . <EOS> I can not see a decision . <EOS> Even in Qatar , we have no decision up to now . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : At the December meeting there was a commitment to move forward with the single currency , realistically by 2010 , or is that just a target ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : It 's just a target . <EOS> I do n't think we will reach that target . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : What is a realistic timeline ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : Well , first we need all of us to agree . <EOS> Most of the GCC countries agree about the currencies but we would like to do it together , and some would like to wait . <EOS> We can not put a target on when it will be done . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : President Bush , during his swing through the Gulf States , was asking the producers to put more oil on the market because of the U.S. recession that may be pending . <EOS> Is it time for OPEC to put more crude oil onto the market ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : Is there is excess oil to be put on the market ? <EOS> I am not sure there is more oil . <EOS> I think all countries at the moment are pumping their capacity , if we are talking in real terms . <EOS> If we are just telling the market there is some excess if something happens , then that is another situation . <EOS> In my opinion everyone is at full speed , enjoying high prices , but there is no excess capacity immediately . <EOS> Maybe there is 200,000 to 300,000 extra with one of the producers , but no more than that . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : We have seen oil stabilize around $ 80 per barrel right now . <EOS> That seems to be the new floor . <EOS> Can we get to $ 100 per barrel and use that as a new floor within the next 12 months ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : Well , anything is possible , but with the slowdown in the United States , and I do n't know what effect in Asia , $ 70 or $ 80 is more likely than $ 100 this year . <EOS> Unless the situation changes in the economy , which from what we hear can not be changed so quickly . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : We have seen a huge debate over the last four weeks about sovereign wealth funds and President Bush has actually gone to put tighter controls and a greater review of these funds . <EOS> Do you think it 's correct to provide greater scrutiny to the funds going into the United States and perhaps into Europe ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : I 'm surprised about these talks . <EOS> We know these talks were more serious six months ago . <EOS> But after the crisis I think most of the sovereign wealth funds , which have helped in the United States and elsewhere in Europe , this has been welcomed by the government . <EOS> They are talking about this fund coming from a different space , from another space , and taking over the market . <EOS> First of all , we are not politically ambitious to play a role in these companies . <EOS> We do not want to take over companies . <EOS> Maybe some , but not all . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : I have talked to both the OECD and the International Monetary Fund and there is discussion about establishing a set of rules to adhere to for these funds . <EOS> Would you go to a set of rules that were international in terms of the outlook as opposed to country by country ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : If it is an international rule done by an international body and consulting all the countries , yes . <EOS> But if there is one country that wants to set its own rules , we will respect their rules as a country , but we have other options to invest somewhere else . <EOS> -LRB- JD -RRB- : You have a very good dialogue with the White House . <EOS> Were you surprised by President Bush 's actions ? <EOS> -LRB- HA -RRB- : Well , I do n't know exactly what he means by this , but let us wait and see what will come . <EOS> E-mail to a friend

Married 26 years Mary was still in her nightgown and robe , sipping a cappuccino in the kitchen of the Washington , D.C. , brownstone she shared with her husband , Del , when he walked in and announced he wanted to live alone . <EOS> They had been married for 21 years . <EOS> `` I did n't know what had hit me , '' Mary , 64 , recalls of that fall morning in 2005 . <EOS> `` I wondered , does he have a girlfriend ? <EOS> A boyfriend ? <EOS> I had no idea what was wrong . '' <EOS> Although the couple 's relationship had been strained for a few months , Mary simply assumed they were going through a rough patch . <EOS> She attributed Del 's loss of interest in sex and his suddenly quick temper to stress from his high-pressure job as a financial analyst . <EOS> `` Del was so on edge that he would yell at me about every little thing -- like a knife accidentally placed in the dishwasher with the point up , '' says Mary , a writer and a teacher . <EOS> Still , she figured that things would soon return to normal . <EOS> RealSimple.com : How to break bad habits For Del , the decision had been a long time coming . <EOS> Increasingly restless within his marriage , he wondered whether it was holding him back from leading a more exciting life . <EOS> `` I knew the problem was n't Mary -- it was me , '' he says . <EOS> `` And I felt I needed to work through my mixed emotions alone . '' <EOS> To Mary 's frustration , Del could n't articulate any of these concerns -- all she knew was that he wanted a separation . <EOS> She and Del took turns sleeping in the guest room for a few months until she moved into an apartment of her own . <EOS> By January 2006 , the couple had hired attorneys . <EOS> Their home , which they had spent the previous seven years painstakingly renovating , was put up for sale . <EOS> Mary felt `` broken '' without Del , who had helped her raise two children from her first marriage and supported her through the deaths of her parents and sister . <EOS> `` He understood me better than anyone , '' she says . <EOS> She tried to move on and began dating other men -- to little avail . <EOS> `` I was still in love with my husband . '' <EOS> For Del , the bachelor lifestyle lost its luster rather quickly . <EOS> `` I thought the separation would allow me to make all those friends I never had , do all the things I never did , '' says Del , 61 . <EOS> But in reality his days were fairly mundane . <EOS> `` I went to work , went to the gym , and spent the rest of my time reading . '' <EOS> He also found himself stalling on the divorce negotiations , bringing up smaller and smaller details . <EOS> In retrospect , he realizes he probably did that to prolong the process indefinitely . <EOS> By August 2009 , the couple had cautiously started spending time together again , even venturing out on a few dates . <EOS> `` It was n't the dinners or dances that made me feel in love , but the conversations , '' says Mary . <EOS> Del , who had been seeing a therapist , finally opened up to her about his worries and fears . <EOS> `` To me , the most seductive thing a man can do is be truly honest , '' says Mary . <EOS> Del had clearly experienced a change of heart . <EOS> But Mary , concerned it would n't last , wanted time to think . <EOS> In the winter of 2009 , she took an extended trip alone to Paris . <EOS> One morning , as she was having her breakfast , her cell phone rang . <EOS> It was Del. . <EOS> He had flown in from D.C. and was outside her building . <EOS> Could he come up ? <EOS> Mary buzzed him in , and when he reached her doorway , suitcase in hand , he told her how much he loved her . <EOS> That grand romantic gesture , so out of character for Del , `` moved me deeply , '' says Mary . <EOS> `` At that moment , I thought our marriage could be saved .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama hammered away at each other 's judgment on the economy , domestic policy and foreign affairs as they faced off in their second presidential debate . <EOS> Obama tried to tie McCain to President Bush 's `` failed '' policies , while McCain pushed his image as a `` consistent reformer '' at the debate , which took place at Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee . <EOS> The debate was set up as a town hall meeting , and the audience was made up of undecided voters . <EOS> Obama and McCain fielded questions from the crowd , Internet participants and moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News . <EOS> The candidates spoke directly to each other at times , but at other times they spoke as if their opponent were not on the same stage , a few feet away . <EOS> Debate report card In comparison to the first debate , Tuesday 's event -- which came on the heels of several days of increasingly aggressive attacks from both sides -- took on a more contentious tone . <EOS> On foreign policy , McCain charged that Obama `` does not understand '' the country 's national security challenges . <EOS> McCain said he knows how to handle foreign affairs and questioned Obama 's ability to do so . <EOS> Analysts weigh in on the debate `` Sen. Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge . <EOS> He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia . <EOS> And in his short career , he does not understand our national security challenges , '' McCain said . <EOS> `` We do n't have time for on-the-job training , my friends . '' <EOS> McCain said the `` challenge '' facing a president considering using military force `` is to know when to go in and when not . '' <EOS> `` My judgment is something that I think I have a record to stand on , '' McCain said . <EOS> Video highlights of key moments Obama shot back and questioned McCain 's judgment in supporting the invasion of Iraq . <EOS> `` When Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq , he suggested it was going to be quick and easy , we 'd be greeted as liberators , '' he said . <EOS> `` That was the wrong judgment , and it 's been costly to us . '' <EOS> The candidates spent about 30 minutes of the debate focusing on foreign affairs . <EOS> They spoke about the economy for about 45 minutes and spent 15 minutes discussing domestic issues . <EOS> See scenes from the debate A national poll of debate watchers suggested that Obama won the presidential debate . <EOS> Post-debate poll Fifty-four percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released 30 minutes after the end of the debate said that Obama did the best job , while 30 percent said McCain performed better . <EOS> The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone with 675 adult Americans who watched the debate . <EOS> All interviews were taken after the end of the debate . <EOS> The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points . <EOS> iReport.com : Tell us who you think won round two At the start of the debate , Obama said the country is in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . <EOS> He blamed President Bush and McCain for the crisis , saying they had worked to `` strip away regulation .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nelson Mandela 's willingness to forgive and forget helped peacefully end an era of white domination in his native South Africa . <EOS> But as news of his death spread , mourners there and around the world professed that he , himself , would never be forgotten . <EOS> `` Mandela 's biggest legacy ... was his remarkable lack of bitterness and the way he did not only talk about reconciliation , but he made reconciliation happen in South Africa , '' said F.W. de Klerk , South Africa 's last white president before giving way to Mandela , the country 's first black leader . <EOS> South Africa 's current leader announced late Thursday that , after years suffering from health ailments , the man known widely by his clan name of Madiba died at 8:50 p.m. -LRB- 1:50 p.m. ET -RRB- surrounded by family . <EOS> He was 95 . <EOS> `` He is now resting . <EOS> He is now at peace , '' President Jacob Zuma said late Thursday . <EOS> `` Our nation has lost its greatest son . <EOS> Our people have lost a father . '' <EOS> Special report : Nelson Mandela The official SAPA news agency reported early Friday that Mandela 's body had been moved to a military hospital in Pretoria . <EOS> It 's expected to be embalmed in the next three to four days , after which there will be a public memorial service at a Johannesburg soccer stadium , according to government sources . <EOS> Then , his casket will lie in state for several days in Pretoria , and next week -- probably Friday or Saturday -- it will be flown to his ancestral hometown of Qunu for a state funeral and burial , the sources said . <EOS> Until that funeral , Zuma has ordered flags around South Africa to be `` flown at half-mast , '' something that other countries including the United States and United Kingdom are also doing . <EOS> The African National Congress -- the political party long associated with Mandela -- said `` our nation has lost a colossus , an epitome of humility , equality , justice , peace and the hope of millions . '' <EOS> `` The large African Baobab , who loved Africa as much as he loved South Africa , has fallen , '' the party said in a statement , comparing Mandela to a sturdy tree found in Africa . <EOS> `` Its trunk and seeds will nourish the earth for decades to come . '' <EOS> As news spreads , mourners recall ` remarkable man ' Throngs -- some of them in pajamas , due to the late hour -- gathered outside Mandela 's house in a Johannesburg suburb after word of his death was announced , with people of all races singing , dancing and otherwise paying tribute to the late leader . <EOS> Some said the news had n't sunk in yet , while others expressed relief that he died peacefully , according to the official SAPA news agency . <EOS> `` We must pay tribute to Mandela , the best state leader of all time , '' said 23-year-old Zaid Paruk . <EOS> Similar scenes broke out elsewhere in the country including Soweto , southwest of Johannesburg , where some celebrated Mandela 's life draped in ANC and South African flags . <EOS> Leon Curling-Hope said she was at a work Christmas party when revelers began singing the national anthem upon hearing the news . <EOS> `` Everyone is emotional but the messages that are going out are of love and happiness , '' said Curling-Hope , a CNN iReporter . <EOS> `` Everyone is holding each other singing and talking about the great memories we all have . '' <EOS> Describing him as `` a remarkable man , '' de Klerk told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , `` South Africa , notwithstanding political differences , stands united today , in mourning . '' <EOS> Carrying on the work of Mandela While the pain resonated most in his homeland , news of Mandela 's death echoed worldwide . <EOS> Moments after Zuma spoke , the U.N. Security Council had a moment of silence in his honor , with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon later calling Mandela `` a giant for justice and a down-to-earth inspiration . '' <EOS> Irish leader Enda Kenny said Mandela 's name `` became synonymous with the pursuit of dignity and freedom across the globe . '' <EOS> `` A great light has gone out in the world , '' tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron . <EOS> `` Nelson Mandela was a hero of our time . '' <EOS> Reaction from U.S. politicians was similarly swift , with ex-Presidents George H. W. Bush calling Mandela `` a man of tremendous moral courage '' and Bill Clinton remembering him as `` a man of uncommon grace and compassion , for whom abandoning bitterness and embracing adversaries was not just a political strategy but a way of life . '' <EOS> Obama : ` He belongs to the ages ' `` We 've lost one of the most influential , courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth , '' said current U.S. President Barack Obama , the first black leader of his own country who said his first public activism was an anti-apartheid protest . <EOS> `` He no longer belongs to us . <EOS> He belongs to the ages . '' <EOS> Kenyan activist : Mandela saved my life The immensely popular leader largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years due to his medical issues , including a hospitalization for a lung infection in June . <EOS> On September 1 , Mandela was discharged from a Pretoria hospital where he had been receiving treatment since June , according to Zuma 's office . <EOS> He was moved to a home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton , where a bedroom was transformed into something akin to an intensive care unit , according to his ex-wife , Winnie Madikizela-Mandela . <EOS> Last month , Madikizela-Mandela told South Africa 's Sunday Independent newspaper that tubes used to clear his lungs meant to prevent infections also made it so that he could not speak . <EOS> She said then that he `` remains quite ill , '' with doctors tending to him regularly . <EOS> `` He communicates with the face , you see , '' Madikizela-Mandela told the newspaper then . <EOS> His history of lung problems dates to his days in Robben Island , where he was imprisoned for 27 years as part of his fight to overturn the country 's system of racial segregation . <EOS> Tokyo Sexwale , who was incarcerated a few meters from Mandela , recalled him as `` a very formidable and larger-than-life figure '' who was nonetheless `` very humble '' and loving . <EOS> `` He was embraced even by white wardens , his own jailers , because he demonstrated that through the power of dialogue ... people on different sides , former enemies can come together , '' Sexwale told CNN . <EOS> Toiled to dismantle entrenched apartheid Mandela emerged from prison more prominent than ever and in 1994 -- four years after his release and one year after earning the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk , who was then South Africa 's president -- he became South Africa 's first black president . <EOS> Statesman , President , ambassador to the world Mandela left the presidency in 1999 , but remained one of South Africa 's most respected and revered international ambassadors , a model for world and particularly African leaders . <EOS> And a new generation has been introduced to him through movies such as `` Invictus '' and `` Mandela : Long Walk to Freedom . '' <EOS> The latter film was in the middle of its London premiere when news broke of Mandela 's death , though attendees -- Prince William and Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge , among them -- did n't learn about it until producer Anant Singh came onstage as the closing credits ran . <EOS> He explained that Mandela 's daughters had said the premiere should go on ; there then was a moment of silence in Oden Cinema . <EOS> `` It was as if he was born to teach the age a lesson in humility , in humor and above all else in patience , '' said Bono , the U2 singer and Africa activist . <EOS> `` In the end , Nelson Mandela showed us how to love rather than hate , not because he had never surrendered to rage or violence , but because he learned that love would do a better job . '' <EOS> Hollywood reacts to loss of a legend His last high-profile public appearance came in 2010 , when South Africa hosted soccer 's World Cup . <EOS> His family members and South African officials have updated the public on his life since , including numerous hospitalizations and his eventual return to his Mandela has been hailed as a pioneer , a statesman , a hero , someone who maintained his easy smile and demeanor after decades of turmoil . <EOS> To many South Africans , he was known simply , affectionately as Tata -- the word for father in Xhosa tribe . <EOS> `` What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human , '' said Zuma . <EOS> `` We saw in him what we seek in ourselves .

Apple fans -- including co-founder Steve Wozniak -- lined up on Friday morning for a chance to buy the iPhone 4S , the latest in the company 's line of `` Jesus Phones , '' which includes many under-the-hood improvements . <EOS> The lines , which drew thousands , were part exercises in tech commercialism and part homages to Steve Jobs , Apple 's other co-founder , who died last week following a battle with pancreatic cancer . <EOS> In New York , Apple fans created a makeshift memorial to Jobs that included flowers , photos , iPad boxes and apples -LRB- as in the fruit -RRB- . <EOS> And in Atlanta , some people said they were lining up for the phone in part because of Jobs . <EOS> `` I wanted it anyway , but -LRB- Jobs ' death -RRB- made me sort of want it more because this is the last one I know he worked on , '' Dwight Hill , from an Atlanta suburb , said of his decision to buy the phone . <EOS> `` I just hope the company keeps going in the same direction . '' <EOS> About 200 people had lined up in the wee hours of the morning in New York to buy the new phone , which has a faster processor and a `` digital assistant '' that responds to voice commands and talks back to phone owners , answering their questions . <EOS> Long lines also formed in Asia and Europe as people waited for the phone . <EOS> In Silicon Valley , California , Wozniak , the Apple co-founder who , along with Jobs , helped create the world 's first truly personal computer , sat in an armchair at the front of a line that began forming Thursday afternoon . <EOS> He tapped on his iPad , sipped Diet Dr. Pepper and took photos with fans while he awaited the phone 's release . <EOS> `` I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans , '' Wozniak said . <EOS> `` I just want to be able to talk to my phone . '' <EOS> The iPhone 4S initially was panned by critics , who said it was more of a facelift to the iPhone 4 than a new product . <EOS> The phone 's exterior looks the same as its predecessor , but the guts are new . <EOS> Inside there 's a faster A5 dual-core processor , an improved 8 megapixel camera and a voice assistant named Siri , who will respond to voice commands and answer questions . <EOS> When Brian X. Chen , a tech writer at Wired , tested the phone , he found Siri to be quite the helpful -- and hilarious -- assistant . <EOS> He published a series of his conversations with Siri . <EOS> `` Me : ` I 'm drunk , ' '' he wrote . <EOS> `` Siri : ' I found a number of cabs fairly close to you . ' <EOS> -LRB- Perfect ; it did n't dial my ex-girlfriend . -RRB- '' <EOS> Aside from Jobs , Siri seemed to be one of the main draws for people waiting in line for the iPhone 4S . <EOS> `` I just want the personal assistant , '' said Teresa Sparks , 41 , an Atlanta nurse who had been waiting in line for the phone since 4:45 a.m. Scott England , who also waited in an Atlanta line for the phone , teased a friend of his who said he was buying the iPhone 4S because of the camera . <EOS> Clearly , he said , `` Siri is a big deal , '' not the camera . <EOS> `` He 's got a secretary -- I do n't , '' he joked . <EOS> Becky Waddell , a 33-year-old real-estate agent , also praised Apple 's new digital assistant , which is only available on the iPhone 4S , and which has been compared to HAL 9000 , Skynet and other fictional computer overlords . <EOS> `` I love Siri , '' she said . <EOS> `` We played with it in the store . <EOS> I know for sure it will make me a safer driver . <EOS> I do n't have to scramble through my phone while I 'm driving . <EOS> If I can talk to it and get answers , it 's going to cut out so much time for me . '' <EOS> Plenty of excitement seemed to surround the phone 's release . <EOS> In true Apple-head fashion , two Apple fans in New York said they arrived at the flagship Apple Store 18 days before Friday , and blogged about the experience on a site called iPhoneWhatever , CNNMoney reports . <EOS> Another person arrived at that store on crutches . <EOS> `` I got hit by a car and had surgery a few weeks ago . <EOS> There 's tons of metal plates in my foot -- it shattered , '' David Betz , a 26-year-old bartender , told CNNMoney . <EOS> `` Is it worth it ? <EOS> We 'll find out . '' <EOS> Apple CEO Tim Cook helped unveil the 4S last week a day before Jobs ' death . <EOS> Pre-orders of the phone started on October 7 and beat expectations . <EOS> Apple sold 1 million of the phones in the first 24 hours via its website and carriers AT&T , Verizon and -- for the first time -- Sprint . <EOS> By comparison , Apple reported 600,000 iPhone 4 pre-orders last year in 24 hours , but that included orders placed with overseas carriers . <EOS> The iPhone 4S went on sale Friday at all 245 Apple stores in the U.S. , in addition to the following countries : Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Japan and the United Kingdom . <EOS> The new iPhone will be available in 22 additional countries by the end of October , Apple says . <EOS> Apple stores and other retailers opened at 8 a.m. Friday . <EOS> Online orders can be made at Apple 's online store as well as on AT&T , Verizon and Sprint 's websites . <EOS> If you were hoping to pre-order now and pick up the phone Friday , you 're out of luck . <EOS> Pre-orders at AT&T , Sprint and Verizon are sold out , and phones ordered through Apple 's website may not be delivered for several weeks . <EOS> All of those brick-and-mortar retail stores also will carry the phone , along with select Apple-approved retailers : Radio Shack , Best Buy , Target and Sam 's Club . <EOS> -LRB- Word of warning : Check availability before lining up at one of those third-party sellers . <EOS> Inventory is limited , and some will be filling pre-orders before selling whatever stock may remain . -RRB- <EOS> Customers who buy the phone at an Apple retail store will be offered free in-store setup service , personalized instruction on how to set up e-mail and download apps . <EOS> The phone sells for $ 199 for 16GB of storage , $ 299 for 32GB and $ 399 for 64GB , marking the first time an iPhone has had that much memory . <EOS> It also seems impossible to separate interest in the iPhone 4S with news of Jobs ' death last week . <EOS> Among the legions of Apple 's diehard fans , some have taken saying the `` 4S '' in the phone 's name represents the words `` For Steve . '' <EOS> Although it 's virtually impossible that the company would have done that on purpose -LRB- the phone 's development happened largely when Jobs was still CEO -RRB- it speaks both to the long reach of Jobs ' legacy and the cult-like devotion that some Apple loyalists feel toward the company and its products .
It took five tries and almost 15 years , but there is no question that North Korea 's successful launch of a satellite into orbit on December 11 is a major technological achievement . <EOS> It is not , however , a serious military threat to the United States or other nations . <EOS> North Korea still has a long way to go before they can turn the orbiting of a baby satellite , reportedly tumbling out of control , into the ability to threaten others at long distance with a nuclear weapon . <EOS> If the past is any guide , North Korea 's launch of an Unha-3 rocket will have international security repercussions far out of proportion to its military capability . <EOS> North Korea 's first attempt in launching a satellite in April 1998 under Kim Jong Il failed , but it triggered a panic in the U.S. Proponents of elaborate anti-missile weapons seized on the launch as proof that dictators of small , undeterrable countries could soon attack the U.S. with nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles . <EOS> Read more : Why did North Korea launch a rocket ? <EOS> At the time , a commission chaired by Donald Rumsfeld made headlines with its warning that `` A nation with a well-developed , Scud-based ballistic missile infrastructure would be able to achieve first flight of a long-range missile , up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile range -LRB- greater than 5,500 kilometers -RRB- , within about five years of deciding to do so . '' <EOS> North Korea and Iran had Scud-based missile infrastructures : They were clearly trying to do so . <EOS> Fifteen years later , they have not come close to succeeding . <EOS> But the warning achieved its purpose : Missile defense programs and budgets soared and have never come down . <EOS> Our nation today spends about $ 10 billion a year on such programs , even though the threat never developed as predicted . <EOS> We can expect similar warnings now that Kim Jong Un has done what his father never could . <EOS> And this is the really tragic news . <EOS> Success raises stakes for U.S. missile defense system Governments meeting in emergency session in Seoul and Tokyo will have to produce more than statements of condemnation . <EOS> They will likely support more anti-missile programs . <EOS> The U.S. , feeling the pressure from them and from defense hawks at home , may increase efforts to field more of the systems it is developing . <EOS> We deploy about 30 ground-based interceptors in silos in Alaska and California . <EOS> These systems have some ability to hit a long-range rocket , like the Unha-3 should it be turned into a missile and aimed at the U.S. . <EOS> Some in Congress will no doubt demand that we deploy more . <EOS> We are fielding interceptors at sea aboard Aegis-class destroyers and cruisers that have some capability against short-range missiles , with plans to grow the program to longer-range missiles and deploy them in Eastern Europe . <EOS> The U.S. Defense Department just recently approved arms sales to Japan to help that nation upgrade its Aegis anti-missile system . <EOS> Pressures will mount to deploy more capable anti-missile systems in Asia . <EOS> Read more : North Korea silences doubters , raises fears with rocket launch China and Russia will almost certainly react to these deployments , believing that they are aimed at them , not North Korea or Iran . <EOS> This will chill efforts to negotiate reductions in Cold War stockpiles of nuclear weapons . <EOS> How can we reduce , they will ask , if the U.S. is racing to ring us with new weapons ? <EOS> There is no reason for this cycle of action and reaction . <EOS> There is no threat that warrants the panicked deployment of untested and unreliable anti-missile weapons . <EOS> As my colleague and North Korean expert Philip Yun notes , `` A successful launch was only a matter of time , and it shows a level of technical sophistication that was always there . <EOS> We need to take North Korea seriously but not make it more than it really is . '' <EOS> I pointed out in 2009 , after North Korea 's third failed attempt , that the nation was a long way from having a nuclear-armed ICBM . <EOS> That is still true after this successful launch . <EOS> North Korea would have to achieve three additional breakthroughs . <EOS> First , it would have to demonstrate the reliability of its launcher . <EOS> The first four tests failed . <EOS> This one succeeded . <EOS> Will the next ? <EOS> Sometimes , you really do have to be a rocket scientist to answer questions like this . <EOS> The one I consult is David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists . <EOS> He writes , `` From past launches , we knew that North Korea has been able to build or buy working components for a rocket . <EOS> The main difficulty is getting all the parts to work together and at the same time , given the enormous complexity of rockets . <EOS> Even with this success , North Korea has no confidence in the reliability of the rocket , which undermines its utility for military purposes . '' <EOS> Second , it will have to develop a nuclear warhead small enough and reliable enough to fit on a missile . <EOS> North Korea -LRB- unlike Iran -RRB- has twice tested nuclear devices , but these are believed to be too large and heavy for use in a warhead . <EOS> North Korea would need several more nuclear tests to achieve this capability . <EOS> Read more : China 's reaction Third , as North Korea 's long history demonstrates , it is very hard to get something up into space -- and it is just as hard to bring it safely down . <EOS> North Korea will have to develop and test a re-entry vehicle that can survive the temperatures , pressures and vibration of coming back into the Earth 's atmosphere and the accuracy to land where targeted . <EOS> It is a long journey from initial satellite launch to an ICBM . <EOS> Ask Iran . <EOS> Iran first launched a low-Earth orbit-satellite in 2009 , the same feat North Korea has now duplicated , but Iran does not now , nor is it likely to have anytime soon , an ICBM . <EOS> A new study from the Congressional Research Service concludes that contrary to predictions in the late 1990s that Iran or North Korea or both would have ICBMs by 2015 , `` It is increasingly uncertain whether Iran will be able to achieve an ICBM capability by 2015 . '' <EOS> So , the lessons are : Do n't underestimate North Korea . <EOS> Do n't count on this regime disappearing anytime soon . <EOS> But do n't panic . <EOS> Do n't start an arms race that undermines your greater strategic stability goals . <EOS> We need to take a deep breath and work with our allies to get North Korea back to the bargaining table and off the test ranges .
By now , most of us have probably heard that Mitt and Ann Romney paid just under $ 2 million in taxes on income -- virtually all from investments -- of just under $ 14 million for 2011 , an effective tax rate of 14.1 % . <EOS> This is a low tax rate , lower than the typical middle-class American worker pays , especially when one considers payroll taxes , the largest burden for most Americans . <EOS> It should concern us that individuals of Romney 's wealth -- analysis has put his personal fortune as high as $ 250 million , not counting some $ 100 million in trusts set up for his five children -- pay so little as a percent in taxes . <EOS> It is also correct to note that there appears to be nothing wrong or illegal in the tax returns that Romney released . <EOS> Sure , there are still many unanswered questions , and speculation and innuendo will no doubt continue . <EOS> But all of that is beside the point , or ought to be . <EOS> Romney is really rich . <EOS> It is what it is . <EOS> The real attention should be on a tax system that allows the really rich to pay so little in percentage terms and on the best solution to making that tax system better and fairer . <EOS> Opinion : Republicans risk being the party of mean The knee-jerk reaction is to raise tax rates , as in the so-called Buffett Rule : Anyone earning more than $ 1 million should pay an effective rate of at least 30 % . <EOS> If this rule were in place today , it would more than double the Romneys ' income taxes . <EOS> Only , it would n't . <EOS> The Buffett Rule would n't work , because really rich Americans do not have to show any `` income '' on their tax returns . <EOS> The Romneys paid tax because they hold stocks and securities yielding dividends and interest , and because they sold assets generating capital gains . <EOS> They did n't have to do so . <EOS> The simple strategy of the super-rich is to buy and hold , and to borrow when needed to finance their lifestyles . <EOS> Some basic facts : Any tax consists of a base , or what is being taxed , times a rate . <EOS> The income tax 's base is `` income , '' which comes from labor or wealth . <EOS> Income from labor is hard to hide and easy to tax , as the middle class knows full well . <EOS> Income from wealth is easy to hide and hard to tax -- and perfectly legally . <EOS> A non-dividend-paying stock , like Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway -LRB- or land , artwork , sports franchises -RRB- , does not have to show any taxable income . <EOS> People who own such things can be very rich and live very well . <EOS> If we simply raised tax rates , the super-rich would just as simply stop showing income or selling assets . <EOS> That 's why , under an income tax , we pretty much have to have low rates on investment . <EOS> Does this strike you as unfair ? <EOS> If you 're like most Americans -- i.e. , if you 're middle class -- then your blood may be boiling at the fact that the super rich seem to be able to hold us all hostage to low tax rates under an income tax . <EOS> The important question is -- how do we fix this ? <EOS> The answer lies in switching the tax base before we raise the tax rates . <EOS> Tax spending , rather than work or savings . <EOS> Then , we could apply a 30 % or higher rate to spending at Romney 's level . <EOS> The real inequity shown by the Romneys ' tax situation , after all , is measured by the taxes they pay as a percent of their spending or lifestyle . <EOS> For most Americans , living paycheck to paycheck , spending -LRB- after taxes -RRB- pretty much equals income -LRB- after taxes -RRB- . <EOS> It 's a good guess that the Romneys are spending a great deal more than the income they are showing on their tax returns . <EOS> They should be , if they are well-advised -LRB- and if they are not well-advised , we have other concerns -RRB- . <EOS> What would Romney be spending money on ? <EOS> How about running for president , for one thing . <EOS> Romney spent $ 45 million of `` his own '' money running for president in 2008 -LRB- less than the $ 60 million Ross Perot allegedly spent in 1992 -RRB- . <EOS> I suspect that Romney has spent more of his own money this time around , if only because he has gone further and been more successful in his quest . <EOS> Opinion : Obama , Romney and your pay Here is another turn of the screw . <EOS> Running for president is legally considered a personal expense , nondeductible under the income tax . <EOS> Such expenses , however , are in essence deductible from another American tax , and the largest single one facing the Romneys : the gift and estate tax . <EOS> That so-called death tax applies to what is left over on one 's deathbed . <EOS> The simplest way to avoid it is to spend all that you have and die broke . <EOS> Under current law , Romney 's family would have to pay about $ 80 million in estate taxes after his and Ann 's death . <EOS> If Romney spent $ 45 million in 2008 , at that year 's estate tax rate , his family would have saved more than $ 20 million in taxes because of his presidential run -LRB- no need to discount for present value , as the unspent wealth would have appreciated in value -RRB- . <EOS> In sum , the government is pitching in , in the form of foregone estate tax revenue , for Romney 's and other rich people 's presidential runs . <EOS> It is ironic that the real problem with Romney 's personal financial situation is his spending , not his work or savings , and that no one is paying attention to that . <EOS> Excessive spending at all levels is our national problem , and it is what soon might make us another Greece . <EOS> No one is paying much attention to that , either . <EOS> Meantime , we have a tax system set up to encourage spending and borrowing , especially by the rich . <EOS> The only way to raise taxes under today 's income tax is to increase the burdens on working and saving -- just about the last things we should be doing . <EOS> If we taxed spending , in contrast , the Romneys and other really rich families would see their taxes increase in absolute and percent terms . <EOS> Yet we oppose consumption or spending taxes because we perceive them as regressive . <EOS> It 's all nearly perfectly perverse , and not a peep on point . <EOS> Welcome to politics .
Imagine you served for one year with the U.S. Army in Iraq . <EOS> Imagine you served an additional tour in Afghanistan a year later . <EOS> And imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your Humvee rolled by . <EOS> Your buddy sitting next to you was killed . <EOS> After you left the Army and returned home , you had trouble focusing . <EOS> You had headaches and issues with your vision . <EOS> You realize you returned with what might be a Traumatic Brain Injury . <EOS> And maybe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder , too . <EOS> Imagine you also have two kids younger than 7 who have n't seen you very much for the last half decade . <EOS> Imagine you 're struggling to find a job . <EOS> You 've got a lot on your plate . <EOS> And you 're understandably stressed . <EOS> You do n't want to let down your family . <EOS> And you do n't want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies . <EOS> Opinion : Why women are less free after Iraq War You summon the courage to overcome the stigma , and you go to your local Department of Veterans Affairs to get some help . <EOS> You file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you 've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially . <EOS> You 're hopeful . <EOS> Now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the Department of Veterans Affairs . <EOS> 600 days . <EOS> 600 days of staring at your mailbox . <EOS> 600 days of phone calls to check in . <EOS> 600 days of bills piling up . <EOS> 600 days of disappointment . <EOS> Sounds crazy , right ? <EOS> Well , for thousands of veterans nationwide , it 's real life . <EOS> If you are a young vet who 's filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs in New York or Los Angeles , you will wait an average of 600 days . <EOS> And you 're not alone . <EOS> More than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic logjam that , in 2013 , is the almost too absurd to believe . <EOS> After 10 years of war , three VA secretaries , and an increase in the overall department budget of 40 % since 2009 , an incredible 97 % of veteran 's claims are still on paper . <EOS> Yep , paper . <EOS> America has soldiers in Nevada piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away , but 97 % of our veterans ' benefits claims are still on paper . <EOS> Earlier this month , the Center for Investigative Reporting released a leaked internal VA document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years : the VA backlog problem is even worse than reported . <EOS> The VA has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days . <EOS> For the first claim filed , it 's longer : 316 to 327 days . <EOS> In Los Angeles , that figure is 619 . <EOS> In New York , it 's 642 . <EOS> In Indianapolis , it 's 612 days . <EOS> And vets with first-time claims in Reno , Nevada , wait 681 days . <EOS> The VA has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors , but it has failed to report that , because of staff turnover , the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010 . <EOS> And , in Chicago ; Waco , Texas ; and Oakland , California , the overall number of claims processors has gone down . <EOS> Since the internal documents were leaked last week , we 've yet to see a public response from VA Secretary Eric Shinseki or from the commander in chief . <EOS> Some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan . <EOS> But now , a decade later , President Barack Obama is not answering their calls for help . <EOS> And the public still does n't seem to get it . <EOS> That 's why this week I 'm joining veterans from across America as we take our stories to Washington . <EOS> Hans Blix : Why invading Iraq was a terrible mistake Veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the Capitol to `` Storm the Hill , '' where we 'll be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backlog . <EOS> You can see their faces and read about their stories at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America website , www.IAVA.org . <EOS> They are an amazing group of men and women -LRB- and one dog -RRB- that have overcome tremendous obstacles . <EOS> And now , they 're taking on another one : the VA backlog . <EOS> Just like we 've been trained , we wo n't quit until the job is done . <EOS> No matter how long it takes , we 'll keep fighting . <EOS> Our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices . <EOS> And every single American should stand with us to #EndTheVAbacklog once and for all . <EOS> Ten years after the start of the Iraq War , there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops . <EOS> Now is the time for them to show it .
Richard Dawson , the longtime host of `` Family Feud '' known for planting kisses on female contestants , has died , his son said in a statement Sunday . <EOS> He was 79 . <EOS> `` It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my father passed away this evening from complications due to esophageal cancer , '' Gary Dawson said in a post on his Facebook page . <EOS> `` He was surrounded by his family . <EOS> He was an amazing talent , a loving husband , a great dad , and a doting grandfather . <EOS> He will be missed but always remembered . '' <EOS> Dawson died Saturday night at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles , his son said . <EOS> Dawson was the show 's host from its premiere in 1976 until 1985 . <EOS> He also hosted the show 's 1994-1995 season . <EOS> Dawson told the Archive of American Television in a 2010 interview that his trademark move started early on in the show 's run , when he saw a woman shaking as she struggled to come up with the name of a green vegetable . <EOS> `` I said , ` I 'm gon na do something that my mom would do to me whenever I had a problem of any kind . <EOS> ... And I kissed her on the cheek , and I said , ` That 's for luck . ' <EOS> And she said , ` Asparagus . ' <EOS> ... They went on to win , '' he said . <EOS> Always wearing a flower on his lapel , Dawson was also known for his witty banter with the contestants . <EOS> He said in the Archive of American Television interview that he always tried to be fair and encourage the players . <EOS> Following an answer , Dawson would yell , `` Survey says ... '' as the contestants and television audience waited to see whether their answer appeared on the board . <EOS> Overheard on CNN.com : Richard Dawson , TV ` Hero ' and smooching game-show host `` The thing that I loved about ` Feud , ' we froze a moment in time for these families that had never occurred before , '' he said , adding the show would furnish families with videotapes of the show . <EOS> `` That 's magic , '' he said . <EOS> Dawson was born November 20 , 1932 , in Gosport , Hampshire , England , as Colin Lionel Emm . <EOS> When he was 14 , he joined the Merchant Marines for three years before starting his career as a stand-up comedian in London -- changing his name along the way . <EOS> In the early 1960s , he appeared on television shows including `` Steve Allen '' and `` The Dick Van Dyke Show , '' but it was his performance as a military prisoner in the film `` King Rat '' that led to his role as Cpl. Peter Newkirk , a cockney prisoner of war , on the CBS sitcom `` Hogan 's Heroes , '' his son said . <EOS> It was that role that introduced Dawson to American audiences . <EOS> The show ran `` six years ... a year longer than Hitler , '' Dawson once said , according to his son . <EOS> Dawson became a regular on the game shows `` Match Game '' and `` Match Game PM , '' and was hired to host his first game show , `` Masquerade Party , '' his son said . <EOS> In 1976 , however , he was hired as the host of `` Family Feud . '' <EOS> `` At the height of its success , ` Feud ' was both the number-one daytime show and the number-one syndicated television show , becoming one of the most popular game shows ever , '' another post on Gary Dawson 's Facebook page said . <EOS> The game show aired 11 times a week and also aired 20 primetime specials featuring celebrities . <EOS> Its success made Dawson television 's highest-paid game show host , his son said . <EOS> Dawson said in the interview it was very important to him `` that I could kiss and touch all people . <EOS> To say kiss , it sounds crazy , but they 're all people and that 's how I saw them , whether I liked them or did n't like them . '' <EOS> He said he never thought twice about a contestant 's race . <EOS> `` When I first came here , Petula Clark was on a show with Nat King Cole and he kissed her on the cheek , and 81 stations in the South canceled him . <EOS> I kissed black women daily and nightly -LRB- on `` Family Feud '' -RRB- for 11 years and the world did n't come to an end , did it ? '' <EOS> Dawson and his first wife , British actress Diana Dors , had divorced in the late 1960s , according to his son . <EOS> In the Archive of American Television interview , Dawson discussed meeting his second wife , Gretchen Johnson , when she was a contestant on `` Family Feud . '' <EOS> `` I knew there was just something about this young lady and myself , '' he said . <EOS> He asked her afterward if he could call her , he said . <EOS> At one point , when Johnny Carson was considering retiring as host of `` The Tonight Show , '' Dawson was considered as a replacement , and hosted the show for a week , Gary Dawson said . <EOS> Carson ultimately decided not to retire . <EOS> Later , Dawson appeared in the film `` The Running Man '' with Arnold Schwarzenegger . <EOS> `` He was loved by millions of Americans as a television icon , but loved even more as a husband , a father and grandfather by his family , '' Gary Dawson said . <EOS> In the Archive of American Television interview , Dawson recalled Schwarzenegger as a nice person , but said he was an `` awful governor .

New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the International Monetary Fund , jailed on charges of sexual assault of a chambermaid in his New York City hotel suite , should consider stepping down for the good of the institution , Austria 's finance minister said Tuesday . <EOS> `` Given the circumstances that his bail was not granted , he should think about whether he is damaging the institution , '' Maria Fekter told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , during a meeting of European finance ministers . <EOS> Dominique Strauss-Kahn , 62 , was denied bail by a Manhattan Criminal Court judge and remanded Monday to an 11-by-13-foot cell at New York 's Rikers Island jail complex . <EOS> There , the man whom many refer to as DSK was placed on suicide watch -- a common procedure in high-profile cases , two sources with direct knowledge of the case told CNN . <EOS> The case has shaken the IMF , an organization of 187 countries working to improve world economies by providing loans and guidance . <EOS> It has also shaken the political world in France , where the Socialist Party politician was considered a front-runner to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy . <EOS> But until his next court appearance Friday , Strauss-Kahn will neither be working to save world economies nor to endear himself to French voters . <EOS> Instead , he will be largely left alone -- denied contact with other inmates because of his high-profile status , said a New York Department of Correction spokesman who declined to be named . <EOS> Ahead of Tuesday 's meeting to address the Greek debt burden , Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said the alleged crimes of the IMF chief were `` very serious '' and suggested letting `` justice take its course . '' <EOS> In Ireland , Minister of Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore called the incident a `` disruption . '' <EOS> `` There 's no doubt that an event like that does cause a disruption in the functioning of a body like the IMF when its senior figure is arrested , '' Gilmore said . <EOS> `` We have to wait and see how that works out , and we have to respect the legal process which is under way in New York . '' <EOS> British Foreign Secretary William Hague , who was with Gilmore in Dublin , told reporters he hopes the incident does not affect the `` many important decisions ... before the IMF . '' <EOS> `` At the moment it is important that it functions well , '' Hague said . <EOS> `` So we look to all concerned to make sure that it does . '' <EOS> Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he was confident the scandal would not affect the organization 's broader mission . <EOS> `` Ireland as a country deals with the IMF as an institution , '' Kenny said . <EOS> `` We do n't get involved in any individual situations . '' <EOS> In Washington , U.S. Sen. John Kerry told reporters the situation involving the IMF chief was `` very troubling , if not damning . '' <EOS> `` You 've got to give it a few days to let that develop . <EOS> But if the evidence is what it appears to be , I think it would be very difficult for him to manage . '' <EOS> On Tuesday , IMF spokesman William Murray said in a written statement that the IMF had had no contact with its leader since his arrest . <EOS> In Strauss-Kahn 's absence , First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky has been named acting managing director , `` and the fund continues its normal work , '' Murray said . <EOS> Murray also said Strauss-Kahn 's diplomatic immunity does not apply in the sexual assault case . <EOS> `` The MD 's -LRB- managing director -RRB- immunities are limited and are not applicable to this case , '' he said . <EOS> He added , however , that any IMF-related documents Strauss-Kahn may have had with him or left in the hotel room would be governed by diplomatic immunity and should be returned to the Washington-based organization . <EOS> A former French finance minister , national legislator and economics professor in Paris , Strauss-Kahn became the IMF 's 10th managing director in November 2007 . <EOS> He is also chairman of the IMF executive board . <EOS> The alleged victim is a 32-year-old single mother living in the New York borough of the Bronx who moved to the United States from the West African country of Guinea . <EOS> She had been working at the hotel for at least two years , according to her attorney , Jeffrey Shapiro . <EOS> `` Her world has been turned upside down , '' he said . <EOS> `` She is very scared about her future . '' <EOS> Shapiro said his client is cooperating with police and prosecutors , and would be willing to testify against Strauss-Kahn . <EOS> Strauss-Kahn 's accuser picked the IMF chief out of a lineup Sunday at a New York police station , saying he was the man who had sexually assaulted her , according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation . <EOS> `` She 's recovering -- slowly , '' said Blake Diallo , the general manager of a Harlem restaurant she frequents , who described himself to reporters as her friend . <EOS> The alleged attack began Saturday around noon , when the housekeeper entered Strauss-Kahn 's $ 525 suite on the 28th floor of the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown to clean . <EOS> New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said the economist emerged naked from a room , ran down a hallway after the woman , and attacked her . <EOS> He shut the door , preventing the woman from leaving , according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors . <EOS> `` He grabbed the victim 's chest without consent , attempted to remove her pantyhose '' and forcibly grabbed her between her legs , the complaint said . <EOS> He also forced her to perform oral sex on him , Assistant District Attorney John McConnell said at Monday 's arraignment . <EOS> The criminal complaint alleges that Strauss-Kahn forced the woman to engage `` in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct '' and tried to force her to engage in sexual intercourse . <EOS> He faces charges that include two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act , one count of first-degree attempted rape , one count of first-degree sexual abuse , one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment , one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse . <EOS> The most serious charge , criminal sexual act in the first degree , carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison . <EOS> Afterward , the employee went to the front desk , and staffers alerted police , Browne said . <EOS> By the time officers arrived , Strauss-Kahn had left in the hotel limousine , according to the law enforcement source . <EOS> He called the hotel around the same time police got to the hotel to say he had left his phone behind and asked if it could be delivered to him at the airport . <EOS> Investigators told the hotel staff member to agree to do so and police went to the airport . <EOS> Two plain-clothes Port Authority police detectives led him off the plane , the source said . <EOS> Strauss-Kahn 's attorneys pointed to their client 's lack of a criminal record and the fact that his daughter lives in New York as evidence that he was not a flight risk . <EOS> Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman called the case `` very defensible . '' <EOS> But Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson sided with the prosecution in characterizing Strauss-Kahn as a flight risk and denying him bail . <EOS> The impact of his arrest has perhaps been strongest in France , where Strauss-Kahn , where the Socialist Party leader had been considered a strong challenger to Sarkozy . <EOS> But some observers said Tuesday that his political future appears bleak . <EOS> `` If the accusations are true , Strauss-Kahn will not be able to run for president , '' said Jacques Attali , a political analyst and a former top aide to late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand . <EOS> CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Ivan Watson , Richard Roth , Saskya Vandoorne , Caroline Paterson , David Ariosto , Raelyn Johnson and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Patrick Vieira knows what it takes to win football 's greatest prize -- and the former France star believes Africa is close to claiming a historic first World Cup title . <EOS> Only three teams from the continent have ever reached the quarterfinal stage of the tournament -- Cameroon in 1990 , Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010 -- yet none have made it to the last four . <EOS> Despite high expectations , first sparked by Pele 's prediction in 1977 that `` an African nation will win the World Cup before the year 2000 , '' there have been a series of disappointments . <EOS> Undoubted talent has often fallen foul to ill-discipline on the pitch , arguments off it , ego problems , administrative issues and sheer bad luck . <EOS> Cameroon , Ghana , Ivory Coast , Nigeria and Algeria will all be hoping to overcome these hurdles in Brazil this time and perhaps go even further than their predecessors . <EOS> And Vieira , who helped France to World Cup glory on home soil in 1998 -- coming on as a substitute to set up Emmanuel Petit 's goal in the shock 3-0 final win over Brazil -- is convinced it will not be too long before an African champion is crowned . <EOS> `` I believe -LRB- they can -RRB- and I really hope they will win the World Cup in the near future because I think that will help African football to develop even better , even more , '' says Vieira , who was born in Senegal but moved to France as an eight-year-old . <EOS> `` And when you look at how many big names African football has produced in the last few years , it 's unbelievable , '' he told CNN . <EOS> Those big names include the likes of Samuel Eto'o , Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure , who would all love nothing more than to add a World Cup winners ' medal to their lengthy list of honors in Brazil . <EOS> But while Cameroon and Ivory Coast have such world-beaters among their ranks , Vieira feels they will need to be at the top of their game to avoid past disappointments . <EOS> Quality Ivory Coast has earned the nickname `` the chokers '' -- cruel given the quality of opposition the nation has faced -- after a talented set of individuals struggled to perform when it counted most , failing to make it out of the group stage in both the 2006 and 2010 World Cups . <EOS> `` You need quality . <EOS> When you look at the African national teams individually , they are really talented so they 've got talent , '' Vieira says . <EOS> `` But I think to be in the World Cup , you need your talented players to be at their best because the quality will make you win , the quality will make the difference . <EOS> `` Quality will make the player make the difference at the right time when your team needs you . <EOS> You may just go on to create one chance and you need to score the chance to go to the next round . '' <EOS> Vieira , though , believes that for talented players to flourish they must be in a team that has togetherness and unity . <EOS> Cameroon lacked in that department during its disastrous 2010 campaign , where the `` Indomitable Lions '' had been expected to do well in the first World Cup held on African soil . <EOS> Eto'o threatened to snub the competition after being criticized by compatriot Roger Milla , himself a former World Cup star for Cameroon . <EOS> And when he did turn up , the four-time African player of the year -- who had just won the European Champions League for the third time , on this occasion with Inter Milan -- struggled in South Africa after not being used in his customary striker 's role . <EOS> Arsenal 's Alex Song , meanwhile , found himself on the bench and coach Paul Le Guen was forced to quit after the team failed to register a point for the first time in six appearances at the finals . <EOS> `` I would say togetherness -LRB- is important -RRB- , and I think if you want to do well in the championship , in the World Cup , the team has to be together , '' Vieira says . <EOS> `` It has to fight for the same objective and I believe that togetherness will make them go to the end . '' <EOS> Unity Togetherness certainly played a role in France 's 1998 win . <EOS> Aime Jacquet 's squad was seen as representing a new France , with Vieira born in Senegal , Marcel Desailly from Ghana , Lilian Thuram from Guadeloupe , Zinedine Zidane 's family hailing from Algeria , while others were of Polish and Armenian descent . <EOS> `` We had the players from all around the world and I think we showed the diversity of the French national team , we showed what the diversity of the French people are , '' Vieira says . <EOS> `` We showed to the French nation what France is really . '' <EOS> If an African side 's unity can ever be questioned then it could be argued that it has been a result of African football 's structural failings . <EOS> The Federation Camerounaise de Football temporarily suspended Eto'o from playing for the national team in 2011 for instigating the boycott of a friendly in Algeria over unpaid bonuses . <EOS> Emmanuel Adebayor , meanwhile , has criticized the Togo Federation in the past for its poor organizational skills , blaming the governing body for his late return to English club Tottenham following the 2013 African Cup of Nations . <EOS> `` The only problem in Africa is our leaders , who do not respect us , '' Eto'o told the Confederation of African Football 's -LRB- CAF -RRB- official website . <EOS> `` Until we are respected , other -LRB- continents -RRB- will never have any consideration for us . '' <EOS> Vieira adds : `` I think what African football needs is better organization , better structure , and I think after that we 'll help the players to be more professional when they 're coming to play for their national team ... I think the structure around these players is not strong enough and I think if we do n't have that , it will take time -LRB- for an African nation -RRB- to win the World Cup . '' <EOS> The man in charge of African football -- CAF president Issa Hayatou -- however , feels the structures put in place by his confederation and its member associations should allow for a nation or two to go far in Brazil . <EOS> `` I do not see why Africa can not have one or two of our representatives reach the semifinals or even the final , '' he told CAF 's official website . <EOS> Discipline Two representatives from Africa reaching the semifinals or final would make for huge progress , given that there has never been more than one at a time to reach the knockout stages . <EOS> That statistic could well have been banished in 1998 had Cameroon 's players kept their heads when it mattered most . <EOS> The Indomitable Lions picked up three red cards in just three games , including two in the final group clash against Chile -- a match they drew , when victory would have been enough for a place in the second round alongside Nigeria . <EOS> `` I would talk about discipline -LRB- as being vital if an African team wants to win the World Cup -RRB- , '' Vieira says . <EOS> `` Discipline and sacrifice , so that means you have to concentrate on your objective , you have to concentrate on what you have to do for the months to get at your best , and be at the peak of your game . '' <EOS> Focus Hand-in-hand with discipline often comes focus -- something Nigeria lost for a split-second in 1994 , denying the team a quarterfinal spot , long before Senegal and Ghana 's heroics . <EOS> The Super Eagles were just two minutes away from becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight at their debut World Cup , but let a 1-0 lead slip against Italy before conceding again in extra-time . '' <EOS> -LRB- You must -RRB- focus on your objective because when you are in the World Cup , you can get your head a little bit all over the place , '' Vieira says . <EOS> `` And I think it 's important for you to get focused on your objective , focused on what you want to achieve as a team . '' <EOS> Luck Having all these ingredients is no guarantee for success , however , as at a major international tournament the winning team often needs a little luck along the way . <EOS> Ghana found this out the hard way after a run to the last eight of the 2010 World Cup that captured the imagination of much of Africa -- but was brought to an end in the most controversial of circumstances . <EOS> With the Black Stars ' quarterfinal clash against Uruguay destined for penalties with the scores tied at 1-1 and just seconds remaining , Dominic Adiyiah saw his goal-bound header cleared off the line by Luis Suarez 's hand . <EOS> Suarez was sent off for his actions -- and widely condemned by the world of football afterwards -- but the damage had already been done as Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting spot-kick , before Uruguay went on to win the ensuing penalty shootout . <EOS> Luck was not on the side of Algeria in 1982 , either . <EOS> With the Desert Warriors having already played their final group game , West Germany knew that a one - or two-goal win over Austria would take the neighboring nations through to the second round at the expense of the debutant team . <EOS> After 10 minutes , West Germany took the lead , before the two teams proceeded to kick the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match . <EOS> `` You need luck , because you will not win the best competition if you do not have luck . <EOS> But the luck , you have to provoke it to make it happen , '' says Vieira . <EOS> `` I think when you look at all the African teams who are playing in the World Cup , they lack one of the five ingredients -LRB- quality , togetherness , discipline , focus or luck -RRB- . <EOS> `` So hopefully they will have built it all up in the last few weeks so they will get to the first game where the togetherness , the quality of the players , the focus , and of course the luck at the end -LRB- is all there -RRB- , because luck is very important .

Chances are , there are some people in your life who spend a whole lot of their free time fiddling on the computer , tinkering with their phones in public settings , and yelling at the television when players perform poorly for professional sports teams that they supposedly hate . <EOS> Yes , fantasy sports has become as much of a pastime as the actual playing of real sports in real life , and a testament to its power is FX 's `` The League , '' a half-hour sitcom that follows a group of 30-something males -LRB- and one female -RRB- as they negotiate their own careers and adulthood by going to any length to sabotage their opponents en route to victory . <EOS> `` The League '' was created by `` Seinfeld '' / `` Curb Your Enthusiasm '' vet Jeff Schaffer and his wife , Jackie Marcus Schaffer . <EOS> Both serve as writers , directors and producers for the show . <EOS> `` It 's not just a sports comedy . <EOS> If you know nothing about fantasy football , you 're still going to laugh your ass off , '' Jackie says . <EOS> `` The League '' concluded its third season late last month and enjoyed its best numbers to date . <EOS> Comedy heavyweights such as Seth Rogen , Sarah Silverman , Jeff Goldblum and Will Forte all made guest appearances alongside NFL players Maurice Jones-Drew , Matt Fort and Sidney Rice . <EOS> With the actual playoffs now in full swing , as well as a fourth season for the show slated for next fall , CNN spoke with the Schaffers about the show 's success and the subtle differences between a fantasy football joke and a fantasy league joke . <EOS> CNN : How did the initial pitch for a show about fantasy football go ? <EOS> Jackie : In television , they wo n't really let you through the door unless you have something of an organizing principle . <EOS> For us , a fantasy football league is an adult male or co-ed book club . <EOS> Thirty to forty million people play , and they just do n't play -- they 're obsessed with it . <EOS> We like to say the show is a comedy about people who play fantasy football , not a comedy about fantasy football . <EOS> We were lucky that FX saw that . <EOS> The fantasy football concept is just an excuse for the characters to behave like villains and babies every week . <EOS> Jeff : For us , people go `` Oh , my God , how can you do a show about fantasy football ?

'' <EOS> Now that there 's three season of `` The League , '' what 's different about the comedic styles ? <EOS> Jeff : `` The League '' is written and produced the same way that `` Curb '' is written and produced . <EOS> And `` Curb '' was basically written the same way `` Seinfeld '' was . <EOS> All of it is based on stories and interweaving those in a satisfying half-hour . <EOS> It may seem a little different , because the problems of Larry David are not necessarily the problems of every man . <EOS> But Larry , who watches the show and enjoys it , he 'd say , `` We should do this '' and I 'd say , `` No , we did that on ` The League . ' '' <EOS> Jackie : The dirty little secret is that `` Curb '' and `` Seinfeld '' are much cleaner shows . <EOS> I 'm the one with the dirty sense of humor . <EOS> CNN : `` The League '' has slowly gained a fanbase of these last years . <EOS> What 's been critical to its success ? <EOS> Jackie : We make our show for about $ 750,000 per episode , in about three days . <EOS> All on location , no set . <EOS> And we have six leads . <EOS> It 's a mad dash to make the show , but FX does not have big marketing budgets for their comedies . <EOS> We are completely relying on word of mouth . <EOS> Jeff : What -LRB- FX President -RRB- John Landgraf said to us : `` We need shows that can make their own noise . '' <EOS> Which is fine , and they leave it up to us to make our own noise . <EOS> Our fans are very loyal and passionate and funny , and they 've seemed to embrace the show like it 's their secret . <EOS> People feel very possessive of it and they want to show you this thing that they love . <EOS> CNN : You also have this perfect storm , where the season airs during NFL season and fantasy football leagues are in full swing . <EOS> Jackie : It 's a funny show about a shared passion . <EOS> Jeff : The audience is growing , and we 're super-excited for season four . <EOS> And we 're Tebowing that there will be a season five . <EOS> CNN : The third season seemed to rely less on fantasy football jokes and went into the guys ' lives in a broader sense . <EOS> Jackie : I think what happens when you get to the third season of a show , their lives begin to get fleshed out . <EOS> For example , since the first season , we 've talked about the lure of Andre 's sister being this sexual mentor to the guys . <EOS> As we continue to make those jokes , we decided to make room to meet her . <EOS> You have the stories that you want to tell , but you also have the deep history and the lure that you want to start parceling out . <EOS> The hardest thing about making the show is the time . <EOS> We have 20 minutes and 45 seconds . <EOS> With Jeff and `` Curb Your Enthusiasm , '' they have the luxury of making it however long they feel like making it . <EOS> We try to do a lot of fantasy lines and jokes , and some are more heavy than others . <EOS> Jeff : There may have been less stories about fantasy football-specific stuff , but I thought there were just as many fantasy league stuff . <EOS> The whole arc of the season is that they 've cheated in the draft order . <EOS> That 's not a specific story like the one where Pete 's girlfriend wo n't let him play Michael Vick . <EOS> We try to make the whole season about the league dynamic .
San Diego , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Free James Willie Jones ! <EOS> The world is upside down . <EOS> The act of children bullying the vulnerable has become so common that many adults no longer seem to notice or care , much less do anything to stop it . <EOS> But when a video clip on YouTube shows a father defending his daughter from bullies , some people go ballistic . <EOS> What used to be considered unacceptable is now thought to be normal , and what used to be normal is now unacceptable . <EOS> Jones is facing two misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing a school function . <EOS> He was released from jail after posting a $ 2,000 bond . <EOS> It 's all because , three weeks ago , the 42-year-old father from Lake Mary , Florida , stormed onto a school bus and -- in a screed captured on video -- threatened the bus driver and some of the students with bodily harm . <EOS> `` Now everybody sit down ; sit down , '' Jones says on the tape . <EOS> And then , addressing his daughter : `` Show me which one . <EOS> Show me which one . '' <EOS> The girl points in the direction of a group of students , which Jones then approaches . <EOS> He told them : `` This is my daughter , and I will kill the -LSB- expletive -RSB- who fought her . '' <EOS> He also threatened the bus driver . <EOS> Jones obviously behaved badly . <EOS> But he was trying to do the right thing . <EOS> He did n't board that bus to bully students as some have suggested . <EOS> This is n't a story about a grown man terrorizing kids for the fun of it . <EOS> He was there to defend and protect his 13-year-old daughter , who had been terrorized by real bullies who -- according to what Jones told deputies -- teased his daughter , spat on her , poked her , pushed her , smacked her on the back of her head , twisted her ear and shouted rude comments at her . <EOS> They even threw a liquid-filled condom at another girl , and fragments hit Jones ' daughter . <EOS> According to the sheriff 's report , this abuse eventually drove the girl , who has cerebral palsy , to have an emotional breakdown and threaten suicide . <EOS> Meanwhile , the officials at Greenwood Lakes Middle School have taken a break from PE and PTA to do a little CYA . <EOS> School spokeswoman Regina Murray Klaers told The Associated Press in an e-mail that Jones did not share with school administrators any concerns about his daughter being bullied . <EOS> Jones ' wife , Deborah McFadden-Jones , told the AP that she left messages with a school guidance counselor but that she never heard back . <EOS> As the father told Kiran Chetry , co-host of CNN 's `` American Morning , '' when he learned of the abuse , he acted on instinct . <EOS> `` She finally opened up and told me what was going on , '' Jones said . <EOS> `` And from there , you know , being a dad just loving my daughter ... and just loving all my kids , you know . <EOS> ... -LSB- At -RSB- that point , my heart broke when I -LSB- saw -RSB- her standing there ... -LSB- she -RSB- was n't going to get on the bus crying . <EOS> And a dad is a dad . <EOS> And I was going to be her protector that day . '' <EOS> That 's what this was : A father protecting his daughter . <EOS> And if that little girl could n't rely on her dad to protect her , just whom in this world is she supposed to rely on ? <EOS> At an emotional news conference this week , Jones acknowledged that his behavior was wrong and apologized for it . <EOS> `` If you see the tape , '' he said , `` I feel like I was backed up against the wall as a parent . <EOS> I just did n't know where else to go . '' <EOS> Yet , Jones said , parents should not follow his example . <EOS> `` We definitely do n't want to promote that , '' he said . <EOS> `` We do n't want vigilantes going on buses , threatening kids , because kids have rights too . '' <EOS> Oh yeah , as Americans , we have rights . <EOS> We know all about our rights . <EOS> We assert our rights . <EOS> We do n't think twice about hiring lawyers to defend our rights . <EOS> But what we have trouble with is the other half of the social contract : responsibility . <EOS> That includes the responsibility to treat one another with dignity and respect , and not prey on those who ca n't defend themselves . <EOS> And the responsibility of parents to raise good kids who do n't get their jollies from causing classmates mental and emotional anguish . <EOS> And the responsibility of school officials to take seriously the idea that they act in loco parentis -LRB- in place of parents -RRB- and that our children 's safety rests in their hands . <EOS> Jones ' attorney has said she is hoping to get the charges against him dropped . <EOS> She has even offered to have her client give speeches against bullying as a form of community service . <EOS> The attorney is half right . <EOS> The charges in this case should be dropped -- immediately . <EOS> And I 'd like to see charges filed against the teenage bullies . <EOS> In an ideal world , we 'd also charge their parents for bungling the job of raising these kids . <EOS> But Jones should n't waste his time giving speeches about bullying . <EOS> Instead , he should lecture audiences about something that is really important to our society and that a lot of people do n't know how to do but that he seems pretty good at : parenting . <EOS> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette .
NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into a chilly Hudson River on Thursday , apparently after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from New York 's LaGuardia Airport , according to officials and passengers . <EOS> iReporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in the river . <EOS> Everyone on board was accounted for and alive , officials said . <EOS> About 15 people were being treated at hospitals and others were being evaluated at triage centers . <EOS> Flight 1549 , headed to Charlotte , North Carolina , was airborne less than three minutes , according to FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown . <EOS> The pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency , a New Jersey State Police source said . <EOS> `` I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves , '' said passenger Fred Berretta . <EOS> `` It was quite stunning . '' <EOS> Watch passenger describe landing He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart , but it did not . <EOS> `` It was a great landing , '' Berretta said . <EOS> Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia saw the plane clear the George Washington Bridge by less than 900 feet before gliding into the water about 3:31 p.m. , an aviation source told CNN . <EOS> iReport.com : Are you there ? <EOS> Send images Witness Ben Vonklemperer said he watched the plane from the 25th floor of an office building . <EOS> `` If someone 's going to land a plane in the water , this seemed the best possible way to do it , '' Vonklemperer said . <EOS> `` The way they hit it was very gradual . <EOS> A very slow contact with the water . '' <EOS> As the situation began to settle Thursday evening , the flight 's pilot , Chesley B. `` Sully '' Sullenberger , emerged as a hero , with praise being heaped on him by passengers , officials and aviation experts . <EOS> `` I do n't think there 's enough praise to go around for someone who does something like this . <EOS> This is something you really ca n't prepare for , '' said former Delta pilot Denny Walsh . <EOS> `` You really do n't practice water landings in commercial airplanes . <EOS> Just the sheer expertise he demonstrated is amazing . '' <EOS> US Airways CEO Doug Parker said it would be premature to speculate about the cause of the accident until the National Transportation Safety Board , which is sending a team to the site , completed an investigation . <EOS> A source familiar with the situation , however , told CNN the pilot reported a double bird strike , but it was unclear whether that meant birds in both engines or two birds in one engine . <EOS> The pilot initially said he needed to go back , and air traffic controllers started to give him clearance to do so , but the pilot said he wanted to head to Teterboro , New Jersey , because it was closer . <EOS> That was the last transmission from the pilot , the source said . <EOS> Passenger Alberto Panero said that within a few minutes after takeoff , he heard a loud bang and smelled smoke . <EOS> Watch passenger say he heard a loud bang `` That 's when we knew we were going down and into the water . <EOS> We just hit , and somehow the plane stayed afloat and we were able to get on the raft . <EOS> It 's just incredible right now that everybody 's still alive . '' <EOS> Passenger Jeff Kolodjay of Norwalk , Connecticut , said he was sitting in seat 22A , near one of the engines . <EOS> `` The captain came on and said , ` Look , we 're going down . <EOS> Brace for impact . ' <EOS> Everyone looked at each other and we said our prayers . <EOS> I said about five Hail Marys , '' said Kolodjay , who was headed to Charlotte to play golf . <EOS> `` The plane started filling with water pretty quick , '' he said . <EOS> `` It was scary . <EOS> There was a lady with her baby on my left-hand shoulder , and she was crawling over the seats . '' <EOS> Watch footage of plane in water Police , fire and Coast Guard boats , along with commercial ferries , were quickly on the scene as passengers lined up on slightly submerged safety chutes . <EOS> New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said later Thursday that the plane was tied to a pier at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan . <EOS> As night fell , Coast Guard and FDNY boats remained at the scene . <EOS> President Bush commended those involved in the rescue . <EOS> `` Laura and I are inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew as well as the dedication and selflessness of the emergency responders and volunteers who rescued passengers from the icy waters of the Hudson , '' he said . <EOS> Bloomberg also commended the pilot for not leaving the plane until he had checked to make sure everyone had been been evacuated . <EOS> `` It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out , '' Bloomberg said . <EOS> `` I had a long conversation with the pilot , '' Bloomberg said . <EOS> `` He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off , and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board , and assures us there were not . '' <EOS> `` There is a heroic pilot , '' said Gov. David Paterson . <EOS> `` We have had a miracle on 34th Street , I believe we now have a miracle on the Hudson . '' <EOS> The temperature in New York was 20 degrees about the time of the crash off Manhattan 's west side . <EOS> See map of crash site Dr. Gabriel Wilson , associated medical director of the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital , said 55 survivors were checked out and cleared to leave from the scene . <EOS> Those being treated at hospitals included a husband and wife with hypothermia at Roosevelt Hospital , as well as a flight attendant with a leg fracture , hospital spokeswoman Michelle Stiles said . <EOS> Since 1975 , five large jetliners have had major accidents in which bird strikes played a role , according to the Web site of Bird Strike Committee USA , a volunteer group dedicated to reducing the frequency and severity of the strikes . <EOS> More than 56,000 bird strikes were reported to the FAA from 1998 to 2004 , according to the group 's Web site . <EOS> People who believe they may have had relatives on the flight may call US Airways at 1-800-679-8215 within the United States , the airline said . <EOS> CNN 's Mike Brooks , Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CNN picked the brains of the Plastiki 's crew members before they set off on the voyage . <EOS> From the importance of the mission to a pint of Cornish cider , skipper Jo Royle tells CNN about her hopes and fears , how she plans to get through the voyage , and what she looks forward to most at the end of it . <EOS> CNN : What did you want to be when you were young ? <EOS> Royle : I wanted to engineer a way to spend as much time on or by the ocean as possible . <EOS> CNN : What 's the one characteristic that has led you to where you are today ? <EOS> Royle : Thriving off the feeling of living just outside my comfort zone . <EOS> CNN : Who inspires you ? <EOS> Royle : Everybody ! <EOS> CNN : What 's the most important lesson you 've learned about yourself from the Plastiki project ? <EOS> Royle : Put your energy into your beliefs , think outside the box and it will happen . <EOS> CNN : What 's your biggest hope for the expedition ? <EOS> Royle : To communicate to as many people as possible that our oceans are our umbilical cord to life , without healthy oceans we are not healthy , no matter where we are in the world we are directly connected to the ocean . <EOS> CNN : At what point would you define the Plastiki a success ? <EOS> Royle : The Plastiki is already a success , it has proven that we need to think about the way we consume , the way we manufacture products , how we need to think about a products end life before it is created . <EOS> Most importantly it has proven that no one is as smart as everyone ; the Plastiki is a success because she has created a platform for many incredible minds to collaborate and engage in conversations on how we can ensure we leave this world in a better condition than we found it for our future generations . <EOS> At the moment this feels like a tough ambition , but an exciting one ! <EOS> CNN : What are your favorite sea creatures ? <EOS> Royle : Jellyfish , as we know so little about them , but their increasing population is a direct indication of the health of our oceans . <EOS> Dolphins , as they are our true companions when sailing across oceans . <EOS> Seals , as they look so lazy and fat , but if you get on the wrong side of them they certainly show you who 's boss . <EOS> CNN : When is the last time you personally used a plastic bottle ? <EOS> Royle : I 'm not sure , but we still get guests aboard the Plastiki who leave plastic water bottles behind ! <EOS> Have you tried to spend just one week without consuming anything plastic ? <EOS> I have , and it was impossible , I had to steal my flat mate 's toothpaste when I ran out ! <EOS> CNN : What do you most value about nature ? <EOS> Royle : The way she makes your life feel like such a speck in the grand scale of things , your little worries feel so insignificant , the way she can make us feel like a visitor , but has her welcoming arms wide open . <EOS> If we listen and open up she naturally teaches us how to live a sustainable , healthy life . <EOS> She is always boss , we can choose to respect that , and live our lives as a caretaker , or not , but in the end she will always be here . <EOS> CNN : What 's the one creature comfort you 'll miss most when you 're at sea ? <EOS> Royle : Cycling my bike through the countryside . <EOS> My buddies and a good pint of Cornish cider ! <EOS> CNN : Name 3 books you will bring with you on the expedition . <EOS> Royle : I will be researching my Masters dissertation on populations displaced because of human influenced climate change , so lots of journals . <EOS> If anyone has anything on this topic please send it to me ! <EOS> I 'll be taking Sylvia Earle 's latest book , which I am currently reading , but not finding the time to finish . <EOS> I also might take a copy of Jim Dodge 's `` Stone Junction '' . <EOS> CNN : If you had to choose a theme song for the expedition , what would it be ? <EOS> Royle : `` Plastikians '' by Jerry Zeiger -LRB- written just for the Plastiki -RRB- . <EOS> CNN : What 's your favorite adventure film ? <EOS> Royle : `` The Kon Tiki '' . <EOS> CNN : What 's your green motto ? <EOS> Royle : The more time you spend in the natural environment , the more you will naturally become a better caretaker of the planet . <EOS> CNN : What 's the most important thing you 've done to prepare for life at sea ? <EOS> Royle : Lived in a city for a year , this is the longest time for over ten years that I have not been on an ocean adventure . <EOS> As much as I love San Francisco I ca n't wait to get back to life on the ocean . <EOS> CNN : What 's the main emotion you 're feeling right now days before the launch ? <EOS> Royle : My brain is running a million miles an hour to try to dot every `` I '' and cross every `` t '' in the preparations for the passage . <EOS> Once we leave we ca n't pick up what we have forgotten , we just have to make do with what we have . <EOS> CNN : What 's your biggest fear for the expedition ? <EOS> Royle : I do n't have big fears in my mind at the moment , we have spent a long time meticulously preparing the boat with an incredible team of talent . <EOS> I am a sailor , so I have a huge respect for the ocean , and understand the path to take to minimize risk , I am in my element at sea . <EOS> CNN : What 's the first thing you 'll do when you reach Sydney ? <EOS> Royle : Have a shower ! <EOS> I 'll also enjoy the post-adventure feeling of mixed emotions ; having achieved an awesome adventure , but also leaving a tight knit Plastiki family life behind ! <EOS> Oh , and maybe party a little !
Something was different in 2013 . <EOS> Unlike recent years , when some of the major events were powered by groups and movements -- think revolutions that seemed to materialize out of nowhere , public squares occupied without visible leadership -- this year , it was individuals who created the most unexpected or dramatic events . <EOS> Some of this year 's crucial stories resulted from the interaction of individuals challenging institutions , organizations or the status quo . <EOS> Sometimes they failed miserably . <EOS> Other times , they succeeded . <EOS> But mostly they gave a shove to history , trying to knock it onto a different path . <EOS> These are my candidates for what defined 2013 : The spies got out-spied Edward Snowden had n't yet turned 30 when he threw back the curtain , exposing the astonishing scale of surveillance by the National Security Agency . <EOS> While the NSA had its sights on other things , a single contractor in its midst triggered an earthquake . <EOS> Snowden left his NSA job with hundreds of thousands of documents , revealing how the NSA was gobbling up `` meta-data , '' records of telephone calls and e-mails , even from world leaders and U.S. allies . <EOS> The revelations showed an almost omnipotent NSA , capable of learning any of our secrets . <EOS> And yet , it bared an agency that could be embarrassingly bested by a single man . <EOS> To some a hero , to others a traitor , Snowden forced an examination of how far society is willing to allow the government to spy on people 's lives . <EOS> If Snowden did n't act , would we have slipped quickly and easily into an Orwellian state without knowing what our government had been doing ? <EOS> A Pope more concerned with inequality than sexuality In March , Catholic cardinals gathered in Rome to choose an Argentine priest as the new Pope , the first non-European pope in nearly 1,300 years . <EOS> Pope Francis has emerged as the most innovative pope in living memory . <EOS> CNN Poll : Pope 's approval rating sky high He is challenging the mighty forces of tradition in the Church , wearing a benevolent smile while surely facing murmurs of dissent behind Vatican walls . <EOS> The Pope decried the Church 's obsession with homosexuality , abortion and birth control , prodding Catholics to fight poverty and inequality instead . <EOS> He has become an endless source of surprises , phoning his newspaperman to cancel his subscription , paying his hotel bill in person and refusing to move to the papal residence . <EOS> Can Pope Francis succeed in bringing lasting changes to one of the world 's oldest , most conservative institutions ? <EOS> We will find out . <EOS> Struggling Iran pulls a rabbit out of the hat The dispute with Iran over its nuclear weapons began a new chapter with the surprise election of Hassan Rouhani . <EOS> The new Iranian President sharply shifted to conciliatory tones , but much doubt remains about whether that will result in real changes . <EOS> Obama put the odds for a final deal at 50/50 . <EOS> It is Rouhani 's boss , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say in Iran . <EOS> Nothing happens without his approval , not even a change of tone . <EOS> It is not clear he has decided to change the goals of Iran 's nuclear program . <EOS> Almost two decades have passed since the United States and other countries started imposing sanctions on Iran , aiming to prevent what they believe -- and Iran denies -- is a nuclear weapons program . <EOS> Iran and the Washington-led world powers made an interim deal to slow some of Iran 's progress for six months and roll back some sanctions . <EOS> That created excitement in some quarters and consternation in others , especially because Iran appears to have found a way to continue enriching uranium even though the United Nations had specifically demanded it stop . <EOS> Who wins ? <EOS> Some would say Iran , thanks to Rouhani . <EOS> Obama scored self-goal with Obamacare rollout When it comes to individuals challenging the status quo , the President of the United States is not exactly Everyman , but Barack Obama took on the system and then trampled himself in it . <EOS> The story might have been the political dysfunction and the government shutdown that left Americans disgusted with Washington . <EOS> Obama seemed to be scoring points after standing firm against Republicans . <EOS> What tripped him most painfully required no intervention from his critics . <EOS> It was the disastrous rollout of the signature achievement of his presidency , the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare . <EOS> When Americans stopped shaking their heads at the shutdown , they discovered the Obamacare rollout disaster unfolding . <EOS> Obama 's approval rating took a plunge , made steeper by his initial denial that there was a problem . <EOS> When a contrite Obama declared `` That 's on me , '' he found little disagreement . <EOS> In Syria , Obama fumbled and al-Assad stays in power When 2012 drew to a close , we knew the suffering of the Syrian people was nowhere near its end . <EOS> Who would have guessed that by the end of 2013 , the Syrian regime would be strengthened ? <EOS> After calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down in the face of mounting deaths , Obama , along with much of the West , seemed to have no clear idea what to do next . <EOS> He worried that the opposition fighting against his dictatorship would give rise to a new regime dominated by Islamist extremists . <EOS> Obama drew a `` red line , '' saying the use of chemical weapons by al-Assad would change his calculus . <EOS> Then al-Assad used chemical weapons , and Obama announced he had decided the United States had to intervene . <EOS> Obama is not a natural risk-taker . <EOS> When he decided to take action in Syria , he went out on a limb , but quickly he reversed course , afraid to challenge public opinion . <EOS> He surprised everyone with the announcement that he would await congressional authorization . <EOS> The congressional green light looked doubtful when Secretary of State John Kerry off-handedly suggested intervention could be prevented if al-Assad surrendered his chemical weapons . <EOS> Syria 's ally Russia picked up the idea and launched into a diplomatic offensive that saved al-Assad from Western attack and saved Obama from political shame . <EOS> As Russia 's Vladimir Putin made his victory lap , the Syrian people continued to endure relentless assault by al-Assad and his Lebanese ally , Hezbollah . <EOS> The death count has continued to climb , and the winter weather is adding to the misery of Syria 's civilians . <EOS> Putin outwitted Obama , and another dictator gets the last laugh . <EOS> As we look back on 2013 , it 's worth remembering that we are all not just witnesses ; we are the protagonists of our time in history . <EOS> Individuals can change history , for better or worse .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Judith Boutelle plopped herself down on Wednesday and prayed for a helicopter -- the only way out of town . <EOS> She 's one of the hundreds of tourists stranded by days of heavy rain near the majestic Incan ruins of Machu Picchu , in the mountains of southern Peru . <EOS> The rain triggered mudslides that blocked a rail line leading out of a city near the ruins . <EOS> Authorities have evacuated many by helicopter , but bad weather has posed challenges for them . <EOS> `` There 's stress , '' Boutelle said by phone to CNN , `` but we 're comfortable . '' <EOS> She and her husband , Jerry -- 65-year-olds from Petersburg , Illinois -- went to Peru to see the famous ruins . <EOS> They 've been stuck in a town near the ruins for the last three days , waiting for choppers to whisk them out . <EOS> News reports say the rain and floods have killed at least seven people in the region , including a tourist from Argentina . <EOS> An estimated 10,000 people have been affected by the rain and 2,000 homes have been ruined in and around Machu Picchu , authorities said . <EOS> James Fennell , spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Lima , told CNN the Peruvians are saying about 2,000 people need to be evacuated from the region . <EOS> Several hundred tourists have been stranded in Aguas Calientes , a town at the base of popular tourist attraction . <EOS> There also have been reports of stranded people on the Inca Trail , a popular hiking trail that leads to Machu Picchu . <EOS> Peru 's Foreign Trade and Tourism Minister Martin Perez said Wednesday that the elderly , children and pregnant women have priority for evacuation . <EOS> He denied reports of preferential treatment for foreigners , saying 103 of 475 tourists evacuated Tuesday were Peruvian . <EOS> Watch iReport account of Peru flooding Quoted by state media , Perez said authorities were planning to evacuate 120 tourists an hour but need `` the weather 's help . '' <EOS> He said authorities could evacuate 840 tourists if they could get seven hours of decent weather . <EOS> On Wednesday , poor weather threatened the ability of authorities to conduct evacuations , he said , and the forecast calls for rain through Friday . <EOS> Fennell said some Americans might have left by Peruvian aircraft on Monday and 50 were evacuated by U.S. and Peruvian choppers on Tuesday . <EOS> He said that as of Wednesday , officials estimate about 200 U.S. citizens were in Aguas Calientes . <EOS> Fennell said four U.S. government helicopters arrived on Tuesday and two more were expected to help Peru in the evacuation . <EOS> The Peruvian helicopters can accommodate up to 20 people but the U.S. aircraft carry only five . <EOS> Peru also is bringing in food and water to the region , Fennell said . <EOS> `` The evacuation operations were planned to continue today , weather permitting . <EOS> The embassy is totally focused on getting Americans out , '' he told CNN . <EOS> `` We 're very grateful for their efforts , '' Fennell said of the Peruvian government . <EOS> `` We 're totally focused on working with them and getting everybody out quickly and safely . '' <EOS> The embassy says that the train to and from Cusco and Machu Picchu has been canceled because of landslides , and the roads in and out of Machu Picchu have been closed . <EOS> One bridge had collapsed and water has covered the other . <EOS> `` Peruvian authorities are working to open a route out of Machu Picchu , '' the embassy said in a message . <EOS> Cusco is the closest major city to Machu Picchu . <EOS> That 's where Pamela Alvarez , 29 , works as a receptionist at the Royal Inka Hotel . <EOS> She said a Brazilian guest went to Machu Picchu , got stuck there with everyone else and has been unable to come back to the hotel for two days . <EOS> `` All the people are in the train station , waiting for helicopters so they can get out to go to Cusco , '' she said . <EOS> Boutelle said she and her tour group visited Machu Picchu on Sunday and stayed overnight on Monday , but she had n't been able to leave since then . <EOS> She said she and others have been been well-sheltered and well-fed at a hotel , but endured inconveniences . <EOS> For example , people came to Machu Picchu for the day from their hotels in Cusco without the proper amount of clothing or medication for an extended period . <EOS> Boutelle said she and her husband are among a handful left from their group , most of whom have been airlifted out . <EOS> They had hoped to leave on Tuesday after wearily standing in an evacuation line for hours during a chaotic day where people jostled to get on helicopters . <EOS> But they never made it out and were hopeful that they could leave as soon as possible . <EOS> `` We hope today , but we 're pessimistic about it , '' she said . <EOS> `` It 's going to take a long time to evacuate . '' <EOS> Several people fretted about the predicament . <EOS> Roberto Rocafort , a 64-year-old tour manager , said officials in the town have n't been prepared to deal with the eventuality and he said conditions resembled a `` war zone '' for many of the people stranded . <EOS> News reports say people are sleeping on the street , in gyms , schools , trains and tents . <EOS> Wearing days-old clothing , sleeping outside , and lacking money and access to proper medications add up to an `` alarming , difficult and scary '' situation , Rocafort said . <EOS> Rocafort said he 's worried food supplies will dwindle greatly in days if help is n't accelerated . <EOS> `` We need the U.S.A. to help us , '' Rocafort said . <EOS> Rocafort said that thousands of Argentines enjoying their summertime are in the town . <EOS> Argentine Consul in Lima Gabriel Volpi said that about 600 Argentine tourists were trapped and that one of them has died . <EOS> A weather alert has been issued for southern Peru , which has received record rainfall over the past three days , according to the Peruvian national weather service . <EOS> More rain is expected through Friday , though less than what 's already drenched the region . <EOS> A state of emergency has been declared in southeastern Peru , which includes Machu Picchu , according to Javier Velasquez , the president of Peru 's Cabinet . <EOS> Machu Picchu is the ancient Incan city on a mountain in the Andes , standing nearly 8,000 feet -- 2,340 meters -- above sea level in a tropical mountain forest . <EOS> Known as the `` Lost City of the Incas , '' Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and draws tens of thousands of international tourists every year . <EOS> CNN 's Claudia Rebaza and Mark Bixler contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nursing school seemed like a good idea to Tracy Kidd , but not just because she was interested in medicine . <EOS> Tracy Kidd , 37 , just started nursing school . <EOS> Nurses are high in demand , despite the souring economy . <EOS> Kidd , 37 , and her husband recently took a massive pay cut -- the painting business they own in Mesa , Arizona , once brought in about $ 70,000 a month . <EOS> Now they 're lucky to get $ 800 a month . <EOS> They have moved in with Tracy 's father because their house was foreclosed on . <EOS> `` I knew that nurses are always needed , and I did n't want what just happened to us to ever happen again , '' said Kidd , who started a licensed practical nurse -LRB- LPN -RRB- program two weeks ago that will allow her to work while finishing her registered nurse -LRB- RN -RRB- degree . <EOS> Kidd 's logic squares with the numbers : While industries such as manufacturing have had decreasing job openings , there continues to be a deep need for health care positions such as nurses , physician assistants , pharmacists and primary-care physicians . <EOS> See how health job openings compare with other industries With the unemployment rate at 8.1 percent and thousands of Americans getting laid off every day , the employment landscape looks bleak . <EOS> But some experts say there are many job opportunities in the health care sector . <EOS> Nursing The number of nurses usually goes up when the economy goes down , said Beverly Malone , CEO of the National League for Nursing . <EOS> Irrespective of this recession , the number of nurses has been growing anyway because of high demand . <EOS> Nearly 182,000 new students in 2006-2007 entered prelicensure RN programs , which prepare students to sit for the RN licensing exam , according to the National League for Nursing . <EOS> This represents a 9 percent increase over the previous year . <EOS> There are about 2.9 million nurses eligible to practice , with 2.6 million in the workforce , she said . <EOS> As of May 2007 , a registered nurse in the United States earned on average $ 62,480 per year , according to the U.S. Department of Labor 's Bureau of Labor Statistics . <EOS> View a map of jobs and unemployment in the U.S. . <EOS> At the associates level , a student usually takes at least two years to earn a degree , while a Bachelor of Science in Nursing takes at least four years . <EOS> Nurse educators are in huge demand , in part because they earn less than practicing nurses , Malone said . <EOS> A master 's degree is required for these positions , and sometimes a doctorate . <EOS> Physician assistants Jobs for physician assistants have also stayed steady , as these medical practitioners help offset the national physician shortage , said Cindy Lord , president of the American Academy of Physician Assistants . <EOS> Like doctors , physician assistants see patients individually , diagnose conditions , and in some cases even write prescriptions . <EOS> They must at least have telecommunication with a physician , because they are technically working in a team . <EOS> Employment for physician assistants is projected to grow much faster than average because health care institutions increasingly use these practitioners to contain costs , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . <EOS> Rural and inner-city clinics are especially good for job opportunities , the bureau said . <EOS> The average salary for a new graduate from a physician assistant program -- which takes an average of 27 months to complete -- is $ 75,000 to $ 80,000 per year , she said . <EOS> Those who have been practicing longer or specialize in specific fields earn around $ 90,000 , she said . <EOS> To get into a program , many schools require at least two years of college and some health care experience , and college-level biology , chemistry and math courses are sometimes necessary before matriculation . <EOS> Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection to better living Satisfaction with the profession is high -- one survey found that 88 percent of physician assistants would choose that career again , Lord said . <EOS> `` I would do this over a hundred times , '' she said . <EOS> `` The privilege and honor of practicing medicine is very rewarding . '' <EOS> The hospital scene Hospitals say they are still hiring , although there are fewer openings now than normally . <EOS> Massachusetts General Hospital has fewer vacancies now than at any point in the last 10 years , as well as the lowest turnover , said Jeff Davis , senior vice president of human resources . <EOS> That 's because people who have jobs do n't want to leave them , he said . <EOS> Still , there are about 400 openings available at the hospital , which has about 20,000 workers including physicians . <EOS> Nursing jobs are available , and the more skill a job requires , the more it 's in demand at Mass General , he said . <EOS> People looking to change careers can take accreditation courses to become X-ray technologists or professionals involved in patient care , but the more skills you can get , the better , Davis said . <EOS> With the population of Massachusetts aging , more people are likely to utilize the health care system . <EOS> Davis said he would encourage people to become registered nurses or physical therapists in response to that demand . <EOS> The UCLA Health System in Los Angeles , California , has fewer openings than last year or the year before , but is still hiring , said Robin Ludewig , director of recruitment . <EOS> Some of these positions do not require much formalized training . <EOS> Positions in demand include clinical lab scientists , which requires a four-year degree and an internship . <EOS> Sterile processing technicians , who prepare surgical equipment , are also needed , and can get training in community colleges . <EOS> `` It does n't really matter how the economy is . <EOS> People still get ill , '' she said . <EOS> For anyone interested in changing careers to health care , experts recommend exploring courses at local community colleges and vocational schools . <EOS> Some schools offer short courses in medical terminology to get things started . <EOS> With talk of reforming the health care system , it is uncertain how those changes would affect the health care job market . <EOS> Still , there will always be a need for skilled individuals to practice medicine , experts said . <EOS> A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that 9 percent of Americans think health care is the most important issue facing the country . <EOS> The telephone poll of 1,019 adults had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . <EOS> As for nursing student Kidd , she says she 's optimistic about her future , and recognizes that life has its ebbs and flows . <EOS> `` We just happen to have caught ourselves in a bad situation , '' she said . <EOS> `` My husband and I , we 're not stupid people . <EOS> We just really were victims of the economy .

In the wake of the Westgate shopping mall horror in Kenya , your local mall wants you to know it is doing everything possible to protect you . <EOS> That 's bunk -- at least if you listen to one very knowledgeable former beat cop . <EOS> Malls boast of spending millions on security , but that security largely protects merchandise , not people , says Dan Murphy , a retired Bloomington , Minnesota , police officer . <EOS> Shopping malls can do a better job of protecting shoppers from shooters , and it does n't take metal detectors , full-body searches , bomb dogs , legions of security officers or a lot of money , he says -- it just takes the will . <EOS> Questions linger after Kenya mall attack Murphy helped implement a security plan at Bloomington 's Mall of America , one of the nation 's largest shopping malls . <EOS> The framework for the plan grew out of a disaster averted nearly a decade ago . <EOS> In 2004 , Murphy , then a patrol officer on the town 's east side , said he was sent to investigate a man who was giving polished stones and coins to children on a school playground . <EOS> When Murphy located the man a block away , he found the man 's van stocked with rifles and `` bags of ammunition . '' <EOS> The man said he had been `` sent to Earth by Osama bin Laden , '' Murphy said . <EOS> No one was harmed , but that was n't because of a quick , coordinated response by school and police officials . <EOS> In fact , the response was a `` calamity of errors , '' Murphy recalls . <EOS> Angry , Murphy confronted the school principal , faulting her for not responding adequately to the threat . <EOS> The principal , flummoxed , asked Murphy what she should have done , Murphy said . <EOS> And that 's when it struck Murphy : He had no idea . <EOS> `` As a policeman , you 're used to having all the answers ... and I did n't have an answer , '' Murphy said . <EOS> Kenya-style mall attack : Can it happen here ? <EOS> Murphy set out on `` a quest . '' <EOS> He started looking for effective ways to respond to dangerous situations , including `` active shooter '' situations . <EOS> Murphy learned that at the time , Minnesota law required schools to have nine fire drills a year , even though no student had been killed in a school fire for some 40 years . <EOS> But there was no comparable drill to protect students from deranged gunmen , dangerous non-custodial parents , terrorists , or other modern-day threats . <EOS> So Murphy became an advocate of `` lock-down '' drills -- drills in which students and teachers barricade themselves from threats , a tactic that could protect them for the eight minutes it takes , on average , for police to respond . <EOS> Lock-down drills became Murphy 's obsession . <EOS> Building on the work of others , he pushed for all schools to have lock-down drills . <EOS> In 2006 , Minnesota became the first state to require lock-down drills in all schools . <EOS> The legislature mandated five lock-down drills and five fire drills a year . <EOS> Then , in 2007 and 2008 , a spate of shootings struck American shopping malls . <EOS> `` And I started to go , ` Wait a minute . <EOS> What 's working in our schools can work in our shopping malls too , '' Murphy said . <EOS> Man accused of threatening to shoot up Utah mall With his department 's encouragement , Murphy said he approached the Mall of America 's management with the idea of lock-down drills . <EOS> They bit . <EOS> So now , twice a month -- once in the morning and once in the evening , assuring that both work shifts become acquainted with the drills -- the mall 's security department asks patrons to seek shelter in the nearest mall store . <EOS> An alarm buzzes , and a `` lock-down '' message is delivered electronically to every store . <EOS> The store gates are lowered , lights are turned off , and shoppers huddle in a safe spot , typically the back room . <EOS> The drills last only a few minutes . <EOS> `` The whole goal of a lockdown is to minimize potential victims while maximizing the time in which the police can get there to solve your problem , '' Murphy said . <EOS> This exercise costs virtually nothing . <EOS> Any shopping mall , office building , or establishment with a public address system can conduct one . <EOS> It does not infringe on anyone 's constitutional rights . <EOS> Participation is voluntary ; any shopper who does not want to participate can simply walk away . <EOS> Few do . <EOS> The Mall of America thinks the program is of such value that it mandates participation in store leases , Murphy said . <EOS> `` When a new store manager says , do I have to do this , the answer is yes , '' Murphy said . <EOS> `` It takes time and commitment and the willingness to work through it and see it to fruition , '' he added . <EOS> `` And you also have to actually practice your plan . <EOS> It 's got to be a living plan , and you practice it often . '' <EOS> Need a plan ? <EOS> Steal Murphy 's . <EOS> `` I encourage plagiarizing , '' he said . <EOS> -LRB- You got ta love a cop who encourages you to steal . -RRB- <EOS> What threat do foreign jihadists pose ? <EOS> Lock-down drills are `` not a silver bullet , '' Murphy acknowledges . <EOS> `` Sad to say , there is no silver bullet . <EOS> If the bad buy gets in your space , it 's time to attack or flee , '' he said . <EOS> But , Murphy says , if the Mall of America can do it , with its 500 stores , huge eatery , and indoor amusement park , your shopping mall can do it too . <EOS> And they will , he says , if they care more about protecting people than merchandise .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barely a year after the country celebrated its return to democracy , Pakistan is ensnared in a new political crisis . <EOS> Riot police block a street on Thursday leading to a court building in Karachi , Pakistan . <EOS> Thousands of lawyers planned a four-day march to the country 's capital , Islamabad , on Thursday , demanding that the government immediately reinstate judges whom the previous president ousted . <EOS> The protesters plan a sit-in at the parliament building on Monday , and say they will continue their demonstrations indefinitely until their demands are met . <EOS> At the same time , the country 's main opposition leader and his supporters have joined in the nationwide protests , but for reasons of their own . <EOS> The government responded by banning political demonstrations in two of the country 's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh . <EOS> It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday . <EOS> The political chaos has forced the government 's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that 's on the verge of collapse . <EOS> To understand the reasons behind Pakistan 's latest political chaos , one needs to keep three central characters in mind : What do the lawyers want ? <EOS> The lawyers want President Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by former President Musharraf . <EOS> Musharraf fired about 60 judges when he declared a state of emergency in November 2007 . <EOS> The fired judges include 14 of 18 judges who sat on the Supreme Court , including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry . <EOS> Critics say Musharraf sacked the judges because they were preparing to rule against the legitimacy of his third term in office . <EOS> He had been re-elected president by a parliament stacked with his supporters , they said . <EOS> After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year , the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office . <EOS> The deadline came and went . <EOS> Why have the judges not been reinstated ? <EOS> One reason behind the delay , some experts have surmised , may be that the Supreme Court was expected to look into the controversial amnesty granted to former PPP leader Benazir Bhutto and her husband and current party head , Zardari , for corruption charges . <EOS> When Bhutto was prime minister , Zardari was accused many times of corruption , stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks . <EOS> Pakistanis derisively labeled him `` Mr. 10 percent . '' <EOS> Zardari said the cases were politically motivated . <EOS> He spent several years in jail on the charges but was never convicted . <EOS> Bhutto herself faced corruption charges in at least five cases , but was not convicted . <EOS> In October 2007 , with his popularity plummeting and under pressure from the West to hold elections , Musharraf allowed Bhutto to return from exile and participate by granting her and her husband amnesty . <EOS> Bhutto was assassinated during a campaign rally . <EOS> Her husband became head of the party and the new president of Pakistan . <EOS> Why is the opposition protesting ? <EOS> The country 's second-biggest party , the Pakistan Muslim League -- N -LRB- PML-N -RRB- , is led by opposition leader and former Prime Minister Sharif . <EOS> Last month , the Supreme Court ruled that Sharif can not hold public office , citing a criminal record that dates to the late 1990s . <EOS> The court also stripped Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , from his post as chief minister of Punjab -- the Sharif party 's power center . <EOS> The Sharifs condemned the court 's decision as politically motivated . <EOS> They accuse the court of acting at the behest of Zardari . <EOS> Adding to their outrage , Zardari suspended Punjab 's parliament and imposed executive rule there for two months . <EOS> The Zardari administration said the executive rule was needed to maintain stability in the province . <EOS> Supporters of PML-N have rallied in large numbers opposing the ruling . <EOS> Why did the court bar Nawaz Sharif from elected office ? <EOS> The case against Sharif dates to the late 1990s , when he was prime minister . <EOS> At the time , Musharraf was military chief . <EOS> And Sharif feared Musharraf was plotting his ouster . <EOS> When Musharraf was returning home from an overseas trip , Sharif refused the airliner to land . <EOS> That order eventually led to Sharif 's conviction for hijacking and treason when Musharraf took power in a bloodless coup . <EOS> Separately , Sharif also was convicted of corruption . <EOS> He went into exile instead of prison , but returned to Pakistan to challenge Musharraf 's rule in late 2007 . <EOS> However , the election commission barred Sharif from the parliamentary race . <EOS> His brother , Shahbaz , was shut out because of financial irregularities , the commission said . <EOS> The Supreme Court upheld the commission 's decisions . <EOS> What does the turmoil mean for Pakistan ? <EOS> The renewed tensions threaten to take the focus away from the government 's attempts to quash an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency in the country . <EOS> At the same time , Pakistan 's economy is in shambles . <EOS> The worsening security situation is part of the reason . <EOS> Rising food and oil prices have also contributed to the crisis . <EOS> In November , the International Monetary Fund approved a $ 7.6 billion loan to Pakistan to help the South Asian country of 170 million people avoid an economic collapse . <EOS> Many in Pakistan worry that the latest turmoil could once again force the army on to the streets if it worsens . <EOS> In its 61-year history , Pakistan has been under army rule more than half the time . <EOS> For now , Gen.

'' <EOS> But I do it because of how it makes me feel when it 's over . <EOS> I feel so good . <EOS> If I 've felt depressed or down at all , it picks me up and makes me feel great . <EOS> Q : Do you feel you have to do as much as you did 10 years ago ? <EOS> Absolutely not , no . <EOS> I ca n't do what I used to do . <EOS> My body just would n't tolerate what I used to do . <EOS> -LRB- Fonda has had hip and knee replacement surgeries . -RRB- <EOS> The mistake that so many people make is that if they ca n't do what they once did , then they do n't do anything . <EOS> Big mistake . <EOS> It 's important just to do something . <EOS> If you ca n't run , walk . <EOS> ... If you ca n't lift heavy weights , so lift light weights . <EOS> But just keep yourself physically active . <EOS> It makes all the difference not just for your body , but for your brain as well . <EOS> Q : What do you eat ? <EOS> I eat fish , chicken and eggs . <EOS> I eat red meat maybe twice a week . <EOS> But when you are older , it is very important what you eat because your cells regenerate more slowly and also you put on weight more easily because you have less muscle than you used to , so every single calorie you put in your body has to count for something . <EOS> I eat by color . <EOS> I try to eat something dark green , dark purple , red , orange , yellow , white , because they all have different vitamins and minerals in them . <EOS> Q : What foods do you avoid at all costs ? <EOS> Well , I am not a purist . <EOS> I am not perfect . <EOS> Now that the Christmas holiday is coming , I will take a bite of a pecan pie , but I wo n't eat a whole pecan pie . <EOS> I will take a few bites of the dressing , but I will eat a lot of the turkey . <EOS> Turkey meat is so good . <EOS> I will eat it with cranberry sauce and gravy . <EOS> But I try to eat less of the very fattening food and more of the really healthy food . <EOS> Q : What do you think is the secret to a well-lived life ? <EOS> I think it 's more important to be `` interested '' than to try to be `` interesting . '' <EOS> I 've always remained interested and curious and I 've always been a student as well as a teacher , so I think that 's key . <EOS> Also being intentional ... living an intentional life ... thinking about who you are , how you affect other people , how you are perceived in the world and how you can change that to be more positive -- instead of sort of just drifting along like a leaf in the river , being really intentional about how you live . <EOS> When you do yoga , you can do the poses thinking about the grocery shopping or what you are going to do tomorrow , or you can be intentional ... in the moment , being present in what you are doing . <EOS> That 's how to get the most out of life and learning . <EOS> That has been very important to me .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As one of the most anticipated games of 2011 , `` Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds '' -LRB- Capcom -RRB- does n't disappoint with new characters , a story line with uber-villain Galactus and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action . <EOS> After a 10-year hiatus , the popular fighting game brings the battle zones into the third dimension . <EOS> While action remains in two dimensions , the characters are generated in 3-D and provide for a more robust visual image of the fighting . <EOS> Each fight can be one-on-one or tag-team , with three characters on each side . <EOS> One of the biggest question marks as the game 's release neared was who would be in and who would be left off of the Marvel and Capcom casts . <EOS> Seth Killian , special combat adviser for Capcom , said the company wanted to achieve a balance between Japanese and Western characters . <EOS> `` We wanted to include the fan faves -LSB- from Japan -RSB- as well as the key characters from Marvel , '' he said . <EOS> `` But we also wanted to include some fringe characters that have n't been featured before to appeal to each audience . '' <EOS> Thirty-six characters are playable right away , with two more available as downloadable content . <EOS> Signature characters like Spider-Man and Ryu make their return , but only comic book fans may recognize some of the other characters . <EOS> `` We included the Super-Skrull because we could n't have the Fantastic Four and we wanted to have them represented somehow , '' Killian said . <EOS> `` We chose Marvel characters that Japanese fans would think were cool . '' <EOS> Killian said each character has unique and special fighting abilities , so one character does n't feel or act like another . <EOS> Capcom characters are defined by their moves , he said , while the Marvel characters are defined by their powers . <EOS> That structure helped balance out the game and make it fun . <EOS> `` With so many moves and abilities , it becomes more strategic , '' he said . <EOS> `` Which characters can I choose to cover up some weaknesses , or do I just play to my strengths ? <EOS> It is up to the player to figure out how to use them . '' <EOS> The fighting system , while criticized in past versions for the complex button mashing and joystick gyrations required to achieve moves , has also been retooled . <EOS> In an effort to gain fans and reach out to more casual players , the game can be played in simple mode , where only three buttons are needed to attack an opponent . <EOS> This affords new fans who may be familiar with the characters , but not the game , the ability to get into the action right away . <EOS> `` We really wanted to make the game easy to get into , '' Killian said . <EOS> `` Simple mode gives you three attack buttons : light , medium and heavy . <EOS> There is also one ` hyper combo ' and two special attacks . <EOS> That 's it . <EOS> By contrast , -LSB- Capcom character -RSB- Dante has 35 different attacks in the normal mode . '' <EOS> A `` mission mode '' helps players learn the normal attacks , if they want to . <EOS> The missions take characters through different stages where they work on a particular attack to get its sequences right . <EOS> Using attacks in particular combinations increases the player 's power bar , which grants hyper combos and team combos in three-on-three action . <EOS> Killian said designers added a behind-the-scenes feature called hit-stun scaling that prevents infinite combo loops . <EOS> `` It took us three years to develop the game , and a lot of that time goes into balance and technical , '' he said . <EOS> `` We 've designed it for the long term and really think fans are going to enjoy how it plays . '' <EOS> Arcade mode is where the story line comes in . <EOS> Each universe 's top bad guy -- Dr. Doom for Marvel and Albert Wesker -LRB- from `` Resident Evil '' -RRB- for Capcom -- decides to join forces to beat the good guys and rule their respective domains . <EOS> However , as big , evil plans often turn out , their efforts are recognized by someone even more powerful than they are : the world eater Galactus . <EOS> Galactus decides he wants both worlds , and the heroes and villains from each must unite to defeat him . <EOS> Teams of three characters each do battle against each other to determine who will be strong enough to take on the galactic titan . <EOS> Killian said a unique ending sequence plays out for each character after the final battle , and each has alternate uniforms and dialogue that are unique to the character 's persona . <EOS> Nonplayable characters will also make appearances during the story line to add flavor and interest in the mission . <EOS> Characters also have powers and abilities that come out only during specific times in a battle . <EOS> For example , Marvel 's Phoenix will transform to Dark Phoenix after her life bar runs down . <EOS> This includes more powerful attacks but costs Dark Phoenix in life points as time goes on . <EOS> `` Marvel vs. Capcom 3 '' does n't fail to impress . <EOS> The way difficulty can be scaled down should win over new fans while allowing more advanced fighting players to jump right in . <EOS> Simple mode took me through the battles quickly and let me get familiar with some of the new abilities and characters . <EOS> Jumping into mission mode helped me learn moves that I utilized in normal mode and made the action even more vibrant . <EOS> Capcom also hit the mark with interesting voice and movement additions for each character that really heighten enjoyment of the game . <EOS> Deadpool 's taunting and breaking the fourth wall to speak directly to the player were unexpected and very funny . <EOS> Sure , some are going to quibble over which characters were included and which were left out . <EOS> But with 36 to choose from , it will be hard for players to not find a character from either universe they 'll enjoy playing . <EOS> It all works and will provide hours of enjoyment , even after Galactus is defeated . <EOS> And with more downloadable content promised , we wo n't have to wait 10 more years to use Hadouken -LRB- for the uninitiated , that 's a special attack -RRB- on new opponents . <EOS> `` Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds '' is rated T for teens . <EOS> It was released this week for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles . <EOS> This review was done with the Xbox 360 version .
The politics of fear . <EOS> Until recently , that seemed so 10 years ago , right after September 11 , 2001 . <EOS> That is , until ISIS started beheading Americans . <EOS> Now , just six weeks before Election Day , security concerns could be a September surprise that shakes up the midterms . <EOS> Across the country GOP candidates on the ballot in November are using the threat posed by ISIS to dust off an old playbook -- attack Democratic opponents as weak on national security . <EOS> The sun had barely come up Tuesday after a night of new United States and coalition airstrikes in Syria , when New Hampshire Republican Senate challenger Scott Brown released an ad using an ominous image of a fighter holding a black ISIS flag , while Brown talks about the threat from `` radical Islamic terrorists . '' <EOS> Brown , a retired member of the Army National Guard , touts his own experience in the ad before putting up side-by-side pictures of his Democratic opponent , Jeanne Shaheen , and President Obama , saying , `` President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat , not me . '' <EOS> This ad could hit particularly close to home in New Hampshire ; James Foley , the American journalist beheaded by ISIS , was from the Granite State . <EOS> Related : James Foley 's mother `` appalled '' by U.S. government But Republican strategists tell CNN that ads like this are driven by voter data from focus groups and polling all over the country , which signals that security is a rising priority among voters , especially with married women who Republicans rely on in midterm elections . <EOS> Neil Newhouse , a GOP pollster who does work in several competitive races this year , tells CNN security is now a `` top-tier issue that no one saw coming . '' <EOS> CNN Poll : Spike in terror fears In addition to his work for campaigns , Newhouse has polled for years on what he calls `` Walmart Moms '' -- female voters with children 18 or younger at home and shop at Walmart at least once a month . <EOS> During focus-group interviews Newhouse and colleagues conducted earlier this month in Arkansas and Iowa , two key battleground states this November , `` Walmart Moms express specific concern about ISIS , '' Newhouse said in a memo about the data . <EOS> `` This is an unusual for swing voters and not a common theme we have heard in previous groups , '' the memo said . <EOS> Rep. Greg Walden , the Oregon Republican in charge of getting more House Republicans elected in November , also told reporters last week that national security issues were `` popping '' in opinion polls . <EOS> The National Republican Congressional Committee is jumping on that -- rolling out four security-related television commercials last Friday in competitive races , including spots that warned Democrats ' positions make them `` dangerous '' in the face of new threats from ISIS . <EOS> Walden cited `` security moms '' as a key group he believes are already gravitating towards Republican candidates . <EOS> The issue , however , could ensure they go from supporting Republicans to actually making sure to vote . <EOS> Two new ads were released on Tuesday -- more proof that Republicans are all in on this new security strategy . <EOS> Back to the Future ? <EOS> Both Republican and Democratic campaign strategists say this mirrors the approach the GOP used effectively in 2002 and 2004 . <EOS> To former Georgia Sen. Max Cleland -- it is eerily familiar . <EOS> `` That 's exactly what they did to me , '' Cleland told CNN in a telephone interview . <EOS> In 2002 , the year after 9/11 , his GOP opponent Saxby Chambliss ran ads calling him weak on national security . <EOS> Despite the fact that Cleland was a Vietnam War veteran who lost three of his four limbs on the battlefield , Chambliss ' attacks resonated with Georgia voters and Cleland lost his Senate seat . <EOS> Cleland says there were a lot of other reasons for his defeat , but that certainly was a factor . <EOS> So what is his advice to Democrats like Shaheen who are coming under fire on the New Hampshire campaign trail now ? <EOS> `` Fight like hell and tell the people of New Hampshire this is b * llsh * t , '' said Cleland . <EOS> `` The Republicans will use any advantage . <EOS> If the economy was sucking air they would do that now , '' Cleland added . <EOS> Shaheen did in fact release a statement Tuesday pushing back on Brown 's ad questioning her national security chops , saying `` I have supported and will continue to support aggressive action to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria . '' <EOS> She 's not the only Senate Democrat under attack on security . <EOS> Republicans in North Carolina are hitting Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan for failing to focus on the terror threat . <EOS> Hagan is locked in a tight race with GOP candidate Thom Tillis . <EOS> The National Republican Senatorial Committee and Tillis tweeted out a chart on Monday that showed that Hagan had missed half of the hearings on the Senate Armed Services Committee , and as chair of a subcommittee on emerging threats , had not held a hearing on the terror group ISIS at all . <EOS> A spokesman for Hagan acknowledges she did miss Armed Services Committee hearings because they conflicted with other Senate work . <EOS> But Democrats deny that Kagan ignored ISIS in the subcommittee she chairs , saying she held several hearings on counterterrorism , and that Iraq and al Qaeda have been a major focus of all of them . <EOS> ISIS is such a big threat , the Armed Services Chairman wanted to chair hearings on the issue before the entire committee . <EOS> Hagan aides are fighting back by slamming Tillis for not taking a position on whether to arm and train Syrian rebels , which Hagan voted for . <EOS> Obama offers ` broad vision of American leadership ' in U.N. speech Democrats Push Back There is some evidence Democrats are worried that what they call `` the politics of fear '' could work against them . <EOS> Former Iowa state Rep. Staci Appel , who was targeted by the NRCC on Friday , scrambled an ad of her own on the air to respond . <EOS> The GOP used footage of Appel 's response to a question in a recent debate , and suggested she would not support taking away U.S. passports from suspected terrorists . <EOS> Appel responded in her new ad by speaking directly to camera and calling her GOP opponent David Young 's charge `` a lie . '' <EOS> `` I support revoking passports for terrorists , '' said Appel in the ad . <EOS> Still Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg argues the concept of a `` security mom '' -- the kind of voter being targeted in these new ads -- does n't exist . <EOS> She says it 's a myth . <EOS> `` We should not conflate an expression of concern about terrorism with it as a driver of vote choice , '' says Greenberg in a blog for the Huffington Post . <EOS> `` Voters typically look to the President and to the military for security , not to members of Congress , '' says Greenberg . <EOS> `` Moreover , there is a world of difference between where we are now and where we were just after the 9/11 attacks . '' <EOS> On that , GOP pollster Neil Newhouse agrees , calling today 's security concerns much lower than they were in the two elections after 9/11 . <EOS> Still , he insists it has resonance -- especially given how close the ISIS beheadings happened to Election Day . <EOS> The chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee , Rep Steve Israel of New York , says he still believes that middle class economics , not national security , is the dominant factor in how most people will vote . <EOS> Share your view on the airstrikes Israel also argues that this GOP strategy will turn off independent and swing voters in key races . <EOS> `` They -LSB- independent voters -RSB- want to be united during a time of threat and do n't want a political party to divide Americans , '' Israel told CNN . <EOS> `` Using ISIL as a political tool is meant as a strategy to turn out their base , but the inherent problem in pushing partisanship is losing persuadable voters , '' he said , predicting it would `` backfire '' But Walden , Israel 's GOP counterpart , says talking security on the campaign trail is a legitimate issue and fair game . <EOS> Walden told reporters that its ' important for GOP candidates to engage voters on issues they are talking about , and recent developments in the Mideast have made national security one everyone is talking about .
Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child who will be heir to the British throne . <EOS> Here 's what you need to know and the latest developments : The appearance of a couple looking very like William and Catherine outside the hospital where she is expected to give birth provided a moment of excitement -- but it was a stunt organized by The Sun , Britain 's best-selling tabloid newspaper . <EOS> As the wait for the royal baby continues , so does the debate over the Duchess of Cambridge 's actual due date . <EOS> Britain 's Telegraph newspaper reports Friday , citing `` well-placed sources , '' that medical staff at St. Mary 's Hospital -- where Catherine is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was July 19 . <EOS> A royal source told CNN that her due date was July 13 . <EOS> She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July , but did not announce the date . <EOS> Why are some babies overdue ? <EOS> The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary 's Hospital , next to Paddington Station in London . <EOS> It 's where William was born , as was his brother Harry . <EOS> Catherine 's mother , Carole Middleton , is likely to be on hand at the hospital . <EOS> Could the world 's media be camped outside the wrong hospital , though ? <EOS> The Telegraph reported that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading , if she goes into labor while staying at her parents ' home in Berkshire , and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical . <EOS> There 's no doubting the media interest in the royal birth . <EOS> The Sun newspaper is streaming live video of the entrance to the Lindo Wing , as is Stylist magazine . <EOS> The days-long vigil outside the hospital has also inspired a spew of #GreatKateWait tweets from the waiting media pack -- as rounded up by New York Magazine . <EOS> One person who wo n't be at the Lindo Wing is Home Secretary Theresa May . <EOS> Asked by a fellow lawmaker whether she would be attending the royal birth , as was formerly customary , she replied : `` In fact , it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth . <EOS> The tradition -- now defunct -- goes back many centuries , she said , explaining that `` the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby had n't been smuggled in . '' <EOS> Some people are thinking further ahead already . <EOS> An Ipsos Mori poll released Thursday revealed almost two-thirds of those surveyed think William and Catherine 's child should have a normal job before taking on royal duties . <EOS> One in five disagrees . <EOS> However , 70 % of those polled think that it is impossible for the children of royalty to have a normal upbringing . <EOS> The same survey found support for Britain 's monarchy remains high , with more than three-quarters in favor of a monarchy over a republic . <EOS> There 's been plenty of speculation about the baby 's name -- and betting is going strong . <EOS> The famous Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London , which takes in and finds homes for lost and unwanted pets , has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies ' favorites : Alexandra , Charlotte , Elizabeth , Victoria , Grace , James and George . <EOS> Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world . <EOS> On a visit to northern England on Wednesday , she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl . <EOS> The queen replied : `` I do n't think I mind . <EOS> I would very much like it to arrive . <EOS> I 'm going on holiday . '' <EOS> Prince Charles ' wife , Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby 's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon . <EOS> `` We 're all waiting at the end of a telephone , '' she said , in an exchange filmed by ITV . <EOS> `` I hope by the end of the week , he or she will be there . '' <EOS> The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess -LRB- the baby 's name -RRB- of Cambridge , St. James 's Palace said this month . <EOS> However , it could be as long as 10 days before the baby 's name is announced . <EOS> Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine 's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint : a silver penny , dated 2013 , that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl . <EOS> The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor , royal sources tell CNN . <EOS> The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth . <EOS> It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin , signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace . <EOS> There , the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William 's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see . <EOS> The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II , Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations , along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families . <EOS> If the baby arrives in the middle of the night , it 's unlikely the queen will be awoken , so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning . <EOS> Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King 's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park -LRB- 41 rounds -RRB- and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London -LRB- 62 rounds -RRB- after the baby is born . <EOS> William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand , royal sources say . <EOS> There has been speculation it is a girl , however , especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered `` daughter '' while at a public event in Grimsby . <EOS> The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied , `` Thank you , I will take that for my d -- '' but then stopped herself . <EOS> The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William , regardless of gender . <EOS> A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture , which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons . <EOS> It means that if the next royal baby is a girl , she will eventually become queen ; previously , a younger male sibling would have taken precedence . <EOS> The queen 's cousin , Margaret Rhodes , told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood . <EOS> `` I imagine and hope that its early life , until it 's at least in its teens , will be just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life , '' she said . <EOS> It 's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth . <EOS> William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence , royal sources say . <EOS> He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot . <EOS> The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness .
When Genevieve Jeuck and Michael Sallemi came up with their romantic little idea , it seemed perfect . <EOS> They would get married in early October on the rim of the Grand Canyon , just as the cooling winds of autumn were starting to blow . <EOS> With family and friends standing by , they would pledge their love to each other . <EOS> Cue the rainbow , and the cry of the circling eagle . <EOS> Then their uncle showed up . <EOS> Uncle Sam . <EOS> And everything went to hell . <EOS> `` Well , I 've been going through a lot of emotions , '' Genevieve said after the government shutdown put the canyon off limits , and their plans on ice . <EOS> `` I cried . <EOS> I was freaking out . <EOS> I had to make all new plans . '' <EOS> She is not alone . <EOS> About two dozen couples planned to tie the knot in National Parks over the next few days , and now they ca n't even pitch a pup tent . <EOS> `` We 've been joking , '' Genevieve says , `` that the government is going to put a tarp over -LRB- the canyon -RRB- so we ca n't see it . '' <EOS> Party politics fuel shutdown blame game Stubborn Republicans or dogmatic Democrats Listen to Democrats , and the government shutdown is a tale of recklessly stubborn Republicans driving the country into a chasm . <EOS> Listen to Republicans , and it 's a story of cleverly dogmatic Democrats who would rather see calamity than make a deal . <EOS> But listen to many voters and you 'll hear a question : How is it possible that both parties have failed so badly in the relatively simple task of keeping the federal government open for business ? <EOS> `` If I do n't perform at my job , then I do n't get paid , '' Michael , the canyon-stranded groom says . <EOS> `` That should hold true for other people . '' <EOS> It is simple to measure the impact of the shutdown in numbers : more than 843,000 employees may be told to pack up their staplers and go home until they are called back ; a billion dollars a week could be falling out of the economy as a result of the cut in federal spending . <EOS> Business lost , research halted : Impacts of the shutdown An emotional rollercoaster It is also easy to understand why furloughed federal workers are angry . <EOS> After all , one of the perks of government employment has traditionally been stability . <EOS> Not so much anymore . <EOS> Along the National Mall , a woman leaving her government office for what , at the moment , is an undetermined period of time looked disgusted . <EOS> `` We 've been on an emotional rollercoaster for a while . '' <EOS> Defense worker Rob Merritt has already taken a hit to his income this year from the forced budget cuts , and he is struggling with unexpected medical bills . <EOS> While he waits to see how long and severe the shutdown is , he fears for his family of six . <EOS> `` If we were to go into a moderate government shutdown , I 'd probably have to file for bankruptcy . '' <EOS> `` Federal workers have nothing to do with bringing about the government shutdown , '' says William Dougan . <EOS> He 's the head of the National Federation of Federal Employees and adds , `` but they are the ones who are going to feel the impact of it the greatest . '' <EOS> But frustration is echoing among many other Americans , too ; from cities , to the countryside , to the valleys of all those empty national parks . <EOS> Ridiculous closures Part of it is the sheer ridiculousness of what has been caught in the financial and political vise . <EOS> At the National Zoo , there will be no more `` panda cam '' for those keeping track of those little black and white balls of fur . <EOS> Also , in case you 're counting , no tiger , orangutan , or clawed otter cams . <EOS> In orbit , American astronauts will apparently be just fine on the International Space Station , but we wo n't be able to spy on them through NASA TV . <EOS> It also appeared for a while that no one would be watching for asteroids hurtling toward the earth , then the space agency tweeted `` To clarify : Many observatories ... are watching the sky . '' <EOS> That did not stop the galactic snarkiness from Benjamin Barnes , who tweeted right back , `` But we 're all still gon na die , right ? '' <EOS> And on the football field , Air Force may not play Navy this weekend as scheduled . <EOS> Apparently the cost of travel is an issue , although perhaps they no longer have a coin to toss for the kickoff either . <EOS> Boehner learned hard lesson in failed House coup Blocking vets Within a short walk of both the Capitol and the White House , one scene captivated what is clearly maddening about the situation for all sorts of people . <EOS> A group of veterans from Mississippi , many in wheelchairs , came to Washington to see the World War II Memorial , only to find the open-air site fenced off . <EOS> After some consternation , the fences were pushed aside . <EOS> A bagpiper played , the vets went in , and guards just looked on while members of Congress on hand railed about the stupidity of the whole scene . <EOS> Democratic Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa : `` I do n't get it . <EOS> I 'm furious . '' <EOS> Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert from Texas : `` We 've got park service employees out here . <EOS> Why would n't you have them here to allow the veterans in , instead of stand and keep them from coming in ? '' <EOS> Shutdown : Obama blames GOP ` ideological crusade ' Who 's at fault ? <EOS> To be sure , there is enough blame out there to choke a horse . <EOS> Polls show the Republicans taking the worst of it , but Democrats and President Obama are also being hammered for their part in the debacle . <EOS> By late afternoon , the growing tide of unrest seemed to be having some effect . <EOS> Republican Congressman Scott Rigell from Virginia , while still opposing Obamacare , was telling CNN 's Dana Bash he 'd like to see a deal to make it all stop . <EOS> `` Now we 're at a point ... what are we fighting for ? <EOS> I do n't think the continued shutdown helps our conservative agenda . '' <EOS> Indeed , few are arguing that this leap into the economic abyss will help anyone , except voters who might yet want more reasons to think badly of the whole D.C. crowd .
We 're keeping an eye on five high-profile cases this week . <EOS> We may see a verdict in one -LRB- the Whitey Bulger trial -RRB- , a sentence in another -LRB- the Bradley Manning case -RRB- and more fireworks in a third -LRB- the Nidal Hasan court-martial -RRB- . <EOS> Also this week , the lawyer for a teen whose Facebook post landed him in jail will argue that the case be thrown out . <EOS> And we wait to see if a grand jury indicts former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez . <EOS> ` WHITEY ' BULGER CASE : Deliberations resume After deliberating for 28 hours over four days , a federal jury broke for the weekend without announcing a verdict in the trial of reputed Boston crime boss James `` Whitey '' Bulger . <EOS> The eight-man , four-woman panel will resume work Monday morning to process testimony from more than 70 witnesses and more than 800 exhibits compiled during the seven weeks of the trial . <EOS> Bulger , 83 , is accused of racketeering , including involvement in 19 killings , and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year `` reign of terror '' that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995 , when Bulger fled Boston . <EOS> Patricia Donahue , the widow of one of Bulger 's alleged victims , said she believed `` the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us .

In just a few months , Syria 's rebels have transformed themselves from ragtag village defense forces into an armed movement capable of attacking the country 's two largest cities , Aleppo and Damascus . <EOS> Now they are bracing themselves for what one Syrian newspaper has called `` the mother of all battles . '' <EOS> Both the rebels and the regime are building up their manpower in and around Aleppo , Syria 's largest city , where the rebels have made inroads this past week . <EOS> Fighting has already begun . <EOS> Syrian rebels seize military base outside Aleppo Several world leaders have expressed deep concern about a `` devastating '' government counterattack in Aleppo . <EOS> But the rebels , encouraged by the progress they 've made , remain undeterred . <EOS> War crimes in Aleppo , Arab League chief says `` We will fight this dictator and all of his aircraft , tanks and rockets , '' said Ahmed Afash , a rebel squad leader based in Anadan , a rebel-controlled town just six miles north of Aleppo . <EOS> `` We started out this struggle with rocks . '' <EOS> Now they have rocket-propelled grenades , mortars , assault rifles and other powerful weapons . <EOS> Afash and other rebels in Anadan proudly showed off the artillery they had seized from Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . <EOS> `` I 've fired this gun about 2,000 times , '' said rebel Jamal Awar , referring to a double-barreled , anti-aircraft gun on top of a truck . <EOS> Awar , a former bus driver , said he shot down a helicopter several weeks ago with the gun . <EOS> `` I was ecstatic , I was very happy , '' Awar said . <EOS> But even with all the new weapons , can the rebels fend off an air assault ? <EOS> Mustafa Abdullah , a major rebel commander , told CNN there simply is n't enough ammunition to withstand a government siege . <EOS> He said it will `` be just like Homs '' and wept at the thought of a similar massacre . <EOS> World leaders and outside experts have also expressed doubt that the rebels have the weaponry to counter the regime 's aerial threat . <EOS> While they might lack firepower , however , the rebels have plenty of commitment and passion for their cause . <EOS> `` I go to war for my family , for my country , '' said Soukrot Amin , a 23-year-old Aleppo native who recently volunteered to be in the Free Syrian Army . <EOS> `` Because -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- has killed everyone . <EOS> He killed my cousin . <EOS> He destroyed my village . <EOS> He destroyed my home .

'' <EOS> Last week , a bombing in Damascus killed several of the regime 's top defense officials , including al-Assad 's brother-in-law . <EOS> But the rebels ' progress into the Syrian capital seems to have faded as a result of a strong government counterattack . <EOS> Q&A : A bloody mess could get messier The rebels now see Aleppo , the country 's economic hub and its most populous city , as crucial to their cause . <EOS> And they 're throwing much of their manpower in the north of the country to fight for it . <EOS> Some other nearby cities have been abandoned . <EOS> In Atareb , Bashar al-Assad 's troops left behind a bullet-riddled ghost town patrolled by rebels and a handful of shell-shocked residents . <EOS> The Bab el Hawa highway , which ran through the center of the town , was renamed the `` Street of Death '' by rebels . <EOS> Until recently , they said , anyone who dared set foot on the highway became a target . <EOS> Now it 's a mini-graveyard of burned-out armored personnel carriers . <EOS> `` This used to be a very classy area . <EOS> ... The Turks would come here to see our village , '' said a fighter named Abdullah Behri , who lost his left eye to shrapnel during a battle there in May . <EOS> `` Now it has all turned to hell , '' he said , pointing at the town 's deserted streets . <EOS> Is a similar fate in store for Aleppo ? <EOS> In Washington , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that U.S. officials are concerned `` that we will see a massacre in Aleppo -- and that 's what the regime appears to be lining up for . '' <EOS> British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the escalation could lead to a `` devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster . '' <EOS> But the rebels know the risks and they are ready to fight . <EOS> One veteran fighter named Khorshid had no illusions that the battle for Aleppo would be easy . <EOS> He choked back tears Tuesday after burying his slain friend Housam Abdul Rashid . <EOS> Then he swore to return to the front lines . <EOS> `` Tonight , '' Khorshid said . <EOS> `` We must fight Bashar al-Assad , because if not , he will kill us .

Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly 3,900 people , including about 540 children , are believed to have died from the H1N1 flu in the first six months of the epidemic , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday . <EOS> The figure is a sharp increase from previous counts of laboratory-confirmed cases . <EOS> But Dr. Anne Schuchat , the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said the estimate gives a `` more accurate picture '' of the scale of the pandemic . <EOS> The figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country , she said . <EOS> The method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths , which are believed to number about 36,000 a year . <EOS> An estimated 22 million people in the United States have contracted the virus , commonly known as swine flu , resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through October 17 , Schuchat said . <EOS> Among children under 18 , about 8 million are believed to have been sickened , 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died , a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6 . <EOS> About 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill , with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths . <EOS> People over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses , 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths , Schuchat said . <EOS> The prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , she said , but the death rate is `` nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic .

'' <EOS> She told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week . <EOS> The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year 's end , and the CDC had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of October . <EOS> Production delays have hampered agency plans , and the lag has led to criticism of the program . <EOS> A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday found Americans are starting to lose confidence in the government 's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic , though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it .
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Only one-quarter of Americans think the federal stimulus plan has helped the middle class , while a majority say it has helped bankers and investors , according to a new national poll . <EOS> A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning indicates that 25 percent of the public thinks the stimulus has benefited the middle class . <EOS> One-third of the people questioned think the stimulus has helped low-income Americans , with just over four in 10 saying the plan has benefited business executives . <EOS> A majority , 54 percent , think the stimulus has helped bankers and investors . <EOS> `` Opinions on the economic stimulus bill are colored by the perception that it has helped fat cats , but not ordinary Americans , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . <EOS> `` It 's possible that the belief that the stimulus bill helped bankers and CEOs is due to the public confusing the stimulus bill with the various bailout bills that were passed at roughly the same time last year . '' <EOS> The survey also indicates that one-quarter think the stimulus has helped people in their own community , with three in 10 saying it has hurt people in their community and 45 percent saying the plan has had no effect . <EOS> According to a CNN poll released Sunday , 56 percent of the public opposes the stimulus , with 42 percent supportive of the plan . <EOS> Last March , just weeks after President Obama signed the stimulus bill into law , a CNN survey indicated that 54 percent supported the program , with 44 percent opposed . <EOS> The program , formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , attempts to stimulate the country 's economy by increasing federal spending and cutting taxes , at a total cost to the government of $ 862 billion . <EOS> No Republicans in the House of Representatives and only three in the Senate voted for the bill . <EOS> The stimulus was initially thought to have a price tag of $ 787 billion , but the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday increased its forecast for how much the stimulus will add to the nation 's deficit , raising its estimate by $ 75 billion . <EOS> The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted January 8-10 , with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone . <EOS> The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . <EOS> CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
Outgoing Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin , who said just a few weeks ago that Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was `` wrong for the state of Iowa , '' has changed his tune . <EOS> Harkin , who was an ardent supporter of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley in the race to succeed him , sees promise in Ernst as she prepares to represent the Hawkeye state for the next six years . <EOS> `` I think she has the potential to be one , yes , '' Harkin told reporters in typical `` Iowa nice '' fashion on Capitol Hill , when asked if Ernst would be a good senator . <EOS> They all have the potential when they come here . <EOS> I think maybe some of the statements she 's made in the past -- I do n't know -- you know people grow , people grow into jobs . <EOS> I 'll give her the benefit of the doubt . '' <EOS> The senator got into hot water while campaigning against her when he compared Ernst 's looks to Taylor Swift as the race came to a close , though he 's apparently shaken off the results . <EOS> `` Obviously I was disappointed that Bruce Braley did n't get elected . <EOS> Fine guy , great congressman , but hey , that 's the breaks of elections , right ? '' <EOS> he said . <EOS> Ernst beat Braley by eight points in the midterms earlier this month . <EOS> Her win was a key seat Republicans needed to take the majority in the upper chamber . <EOS> Harkin did reach out to Ernst on election night to congratulate her for running a `` great campaign '' but did n't offer any other details . <EOS> Asked for advice he would give Ernst as he concludes his 40-year career in Washington , Harkin said `` if you want to be a good senator , when you come here , forget about the headlines , learn the rules , try to get on good committees , and think about the long term -- about what you can do for your state , for Iowa , in the long term because things do n't happen overnight around here . <EOS> You got ta start thinking about what you want to do that may take you four or five or six years or even beyond to get accomplished .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has created a `` zone of impunity '' by rarely investigating private contractors involved in the unlawful killing of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq , a U.N. human rights envoy said . <EOS> Civil rights activists protest the use of unmanned U.S. drones in Pakistan . <EOS> The U.S. government should track the number of civilians killed in its military operations abroad and limit collateral damage from unmanned drone attacks , Special Investigator Philip Alston said in a stinging report submitted Wednesday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland . <EOS> `` The government has failed to effectively investigate and punish lower-ranking soldiers for such deaths , and has not held senior officers responsible , '' Alston said . <EOS> `` Worse , it has effectively created a zone of impunity for private contractors and civilian intelligence agents by only rarely investigating and prosecuting them . '' <EOS> Alston recommended that the United States establish a national commission to independently look into the policies and practices that are leading to the deaths . <EOS> He also urged that an independent special prosecutor be charged with pursuing criminal allegations against government officials accused of wrongdoing . <EOS> `` First , the government has failed to track and make public the number of civilian casualties , or the conditions under which deaths occurred , '' he said . <EOS> `` Second , the military justice system fails to provide ordinary people , including U.S. citizens and families of Iraqi and Afghan victims , basic information on the status of investigations into civilian casualties or prosecutions resulting therefrom . '' <EOS> Alston called the United States ' reliance on pilotless missile-carrying aircraft `` increasingly common '' and `` deeply troubling .
