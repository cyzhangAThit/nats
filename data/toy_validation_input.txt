-LRB- CNN -RRB- Utah 's governor signed a bill Monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners . <EOS> Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state , Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement . <EOS> A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs can not be obtained . <EOS> `` Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state , '' said Marty Carpenter , a spokesman for Herbert . <EOS> `` We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued . <EOS> However , when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant , enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch , '' he said . <EOS> Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death . <EOS> The last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in Utah . <EOS> A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year . <EOS> CNN 's Tony Marco contributed to this report .
