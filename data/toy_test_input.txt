-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne , Switzerland , on Thursday that limits Iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . <EOS> Expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . <EOS> Just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . <EOS> The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . <EOS> It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . <EOS> Let us address some of these : The most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran . <EOS> That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress . <EOS> But that is not and never was the objective . <EOS> If it had been , there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table . <EOS> Rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond . <EOS> The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . <EOS> It would reduce Iran 's low-enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . <EOS> Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program . <EOS> Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies , Iran denies having such a program , and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . <EOS> Iran 's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about Iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . <EOS> In fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians . <EOS> What 's more , the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran -LRB- i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president -RRB- . <EOS> This of course is not the case . <EOS> The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -LRB- United States , United Kingdom , France , China and Russia -RRB- plus Germany , dubbed the P5 +1 . <EOS> While the United States has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . <EOS> If the agreement reached by the P5 +1 is rejected by Congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas . <EOS> Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases . <EOS> Again , this is not the case . <EOS> Some of the restrictions on Iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . <EOS> But most importantly , the framework agreement includes Iran 's ratification of the Additional Protocol , which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . <EOS> This provision will be permanent . <EOS> It does not sunset . <EOS> Thus , going forward , if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council . <EOS> Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to `` advise and consent . '' <EOS> But the issue is not suited for a treaty . <EOS> Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . <EOS> For example , the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . <EOS> But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced . <EOS> The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran . <EOS> The P5 +1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . <EOS> Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs , human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah . <EOS> As important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear Iran . <EOS> To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . <EOS> This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including Israel . <EOS> Those judgments should be fact-based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Last week , California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state 's history . <EOS> His action was driven by a specific crisis unique to California at the moment -- the severe drought now in its fourth year there -- but it has significance for the whole nation . <EOS> As it has in the past , California is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect the physical limits imposed by planet Earth . <EOS> California developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase , historically speaking . <EOS> This led to a system that all but encourages heavy water use in dry parts of the state , with little consistency in allocation or pricing and little disincentive to waste . <EOS> This has never made a lot of sense , but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it just is n't tenable today in a serious drought . <EOS> As for the drought : It wo n't be the last , and surely wo n't be the worst to come in the remainder of this century . <EOS> Brown 's measures may be temporary , but we can hope that they 'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state 's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users , who are not included in the current measures , although they are the dominant consumers of California 's water . <EOS> How the drought affects rest of the nation What California does now has global significance : Lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world . <EOS> On the Indian subcontinent , where supply ca n't meet the demands of rapid development , groundwater is being depleted much as it is in California , and is an equally unsustainable practice in both places . <EOS> And my colleagues at Columbia recently published a study arguing that drought in Syria was one of the causes of the ongoing war there . <EOS> They also presented strong evidence that the Syrian drought was in part attributable to human-induced climate change -- in itself , another physical constraint the planet places on growth . <EOS> Our energy systems , like our water systems , are not sustainable . <EOS> Is the California drought a consequence of climate change ? <EOS> A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report for which my colleague Richard Seager was lead author , argued that it is n't -LRB- though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil -RRB- . <EOS> California , and southwestern North America , indeed saw worse `` megadroughts '' in the pre-Columbian past , long before any humans burned fossil fuels . <EOS> At the same time , the latest projections are that the odds of such megadroughts are increasing with warming . <EOS> So we 're left with a complex picture , one typical of many extreme weather events . <EOS> We know that human-induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen , while at the same time we ca n't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now . <EOS> Does it matter whether the drought is climate-change-induced or not ? <EOS> From a pragmatic public relations perspective , maybe . <EOS> Extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them , and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks . <EOS> At least in principle , this awareness can help to build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gas emissions . <EOS> I lived in Australia for a year in 2007-08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years -- and that led to water restrictions in nearly all the country 's major cities . <EOS> Though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought was n't clear either , the hardship nonetheless made Australians much more concerned about climate change than Americans were at the time . <EOS> Polls showed that the issue played a significant role in the national elections held during my year there , with a climate-denialist government falling to a much more climate-proactive one -LRB- though the pendulum has since swung back -RRB- . <EOS> But being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event should n't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases . <EOS> Whether we 're talking about a drought in California , a hurricane on the East Coast , a flood in the Midwest or a tornado outbreak on the Plains , the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy . <EOS> The reality and seriousness of human-caused global warming , however , is n't . <EOS> The scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate , and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species , does n't rest on single-event attribution , but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events . <EOS> That big picture is what should motivate us . <EOS> And when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable , in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human-induced vs. natural . <EOS> California could have had this drought , and worse , without global warming . <EOS> Similarly , sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal floods , but cities such as New Orleans , New York and many others were -LRB- and are -RRB- too vulnerable already . <EOS> Because really extreme events are by definition rare , most places have n't seen the worst nature can deliver , even without climate change , in their recent histories . <EOS> So our development planning has tended to proceed under the assumption that that worst wo n't happen , leaving us with infrastructures that are n't properly adapted even to the current climate . <EOS> Many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making California 's water distribution system less wasteful , or New York 's subways more flood-proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come . <EOS> They may not be enough , in the long term , but they 're a start . <EOS> We call these `` no-regrets '' measures , because they are good ideas regardless of how rapidly or slowly global warming proceeds . <EOS> If California can teach the rest of us something about how to design and implement such measures for water , it will be an upside to what otherwise is nothing but a slow-moving disaster .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- When Al-Shabaab gunmen slaughtered 147 people at a college campus in Garissa , Kenya , on Thursday , it was the bloodiest blow Islamist extremists have dealt to the country since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi . <EOS> But it was also yet another pave stone in the long path of violence between Kenya and the Somali militants . <EOS> To understand Thursday 's attack , one must understand this : Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war . <EOS> Although al Qaeda was behind the 1998 attack that killed more than 200 people , Al-Shabaab has killed many more Kenyans and is by far the country 's most persistent tormenter , according to a University of Maryland study . <EOS> Their attacks have notched up since 2008 . <EOS> And in October 2011 , Kenya Defense Forces invaded Somalia , where Al-Shabaab is based , with the crushing Operation Linda Nchi , Swahili for `` Protect the Country . '' <EOS> Thus began a bloody vicious cycle , with Al-Shabaab retaliating on Kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings . <EOS> Here are some of the most heinous attacks on Kenya by the Somali terrorist group . <EOS> Early Thursday , while many students still slept , at least four gunman burst into a Christian prayer service at Garissa University College , leading into Easter Weekend . <EOS> They shot students and took hostages , whom they herded across campus . <EOS> As they encountered students , they separated them into Muslims and Christians . <EOS> They spared the former , eyewitness Joel Ayora said . <EOS> They killed the latter . <EOS> Kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from Somalia 's southern border . <EOS> They killed four gunman , but not before 147 victims were shot dead . <EOS> In December , Al-Shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the Somali border . <EOS> They shot Christian workers dead , and spared their Muslim colleagues . <EOS> Red Cross Workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry . <EOS> It was eye-for-an-eye retaliation , the militants said , for raids Kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists . <EOS> Parallel to Operation Linda Nchi , Kenya has gone after ethnic Somalis within their own borders triggering protest by Human Rights Watch , which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment . <EOS> In a 2011 case , Kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic Somalis in Garissa and let them sit in the mud , while beating some of them , HRW alleged . <EOS> Passengers on a bus in Kenya 's north were told to recite from the Quran or die in November 2014 . <EOS> Shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed Mandera , near Somalia 's border , Al-Shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in . <EOS> Those who failed to recite verses were gunned down , leaving 28 dead . <EOS> In its claim of responsibility , Al-Shabaab said the dead were Christians , and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by Kenyans . <EOS> A day after the attack , Kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into Somalia . <EOS> They claimed to kill 100 Al-Shabaab militants . <EOS> In July , Al-Shabaab gunmen opened fire on the Lamu coast , a popular tourist region , and at a police station in a neighboring county . <EOS> They killed 22 people . <EOS> Last May , tour companies evacuated vacationers from Kenya after the UK and United States issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks . <EOS> Before the Garissa massacre , the Westgate Mall attack was the deepest wound Al-Shabaab had inflicted on Kenya . <EOS> For four days , four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital Nairobi into a cauldron of blood , smoke and rubble . <EOS> Part of the mall collapsed as Kenyan security forces fought for control . <EOS> At least 61 civilians were killed , as well as a handful of security officers . <EOS> Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya participation in Africa Union military operations in Somalia . <EOS> Even with Al-Shabaab 's shooting in Garissa , al Qaeda 's bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest Islamist terror attack on Kenyan soil . <EOS> In short succession , bombs detonated at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania back then . <EOS> The Nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at Dar es Salaam . <EOS> Al Qaeda founding member Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a New York jail , where he still awaits trial . <EOS> He is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- President Barack Obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change , refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point . <EOS> After the event at Washington 's Howard University on Tuesday , Obama sat down with me for a one-on-one interview . <EOS> I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away , as well as how enforceable his action plan is . <EOS> Here are five things I learned : The President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 -LRB- he transferred to Columbia University his junior year -RRB- . <EOS> While in L.A. , he said , the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside . <EOS> He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside . <EOS> He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans `` a lot '' healthier , in addition to being able to `` see the mountains in the background because they are n't covered in smog . '' <EOS> Obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken . <EOS> Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone , and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction . <EOS> The EPA estimates that , between 1970 and 2010 , the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone . <EOS> `` No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change , '' the President told me . <EOS> When I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health , he said , `` We know as temperatures rise , insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up . <EOS> We know , in a very straight-forward fashion , that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase , and so what we 're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts , that people recognize there 's a very personal , potential impact in climate change , and the good news is we can do something about it . '' <EOS> In many ways , Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us , while conceding that we do n't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health . <EOS> When asked what the average American can do about all this , the President encouraged ordinary citizens , doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials `` to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change . '' <EOS> He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week `` to better understand , communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities . '' <EOS> The average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint , including : Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights . <EOS> One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime . <EOS> If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs , we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half . <EOS> Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use . <EOS> According to the U.S. Department of Energy , this practice can save $ 100 a year on your energy bill . <EOS> Use a laptop instead of a desktop . <EOS> Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient , because battery life is a major factor in their design . <EOS> According to Energy Star , a laptop can be up to 80 % more energy-efficient than a desktop . <EOS> Filter your own water . <EOS> Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste , consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store . <EOS> Adjust your curtains and thermostats . <EOS> If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter , you can save big bucks on your energy bill . <EOS> The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15 % on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you 're not at home . <EOS> Obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act . <EOS> He said he believes the statute is `` clear and straightforward . '' <EOS> He said , `` I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision . '' <EOS> At issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so . <EOS> The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states -LRB- without state-based exchanges -RRB- , possibly creating a situation , for example , in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit , but people living in Texas would not . <EOS> Obama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld , however , there is no Plan B. `` Millions of people would lose their health insurance . <EOS> They would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that 's being provided out there . '' <EOS> Obama went on to say , `` I think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against -LSB- the Affordable Care Act -RSB- for ideological reasons . '' <EOS> He told me that he `` gets letters every day from people who say , ` you know what , the Affordable Care Act saved my life or saved my kid 's life because I got insurance . ' ' <EOS> I thought I was healthy ; turns out I had a tumor , but because I went and got a checkup , it was removed in time , and I 'm now cancer-free . ' '' <EOS> He added , `` I think stories like that will be factored in when the Supreme Court takes a look at this case . '' <EOS> CNN 's Ben Tinker contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- It is a city transformed , swollen in size but shrunken in scope , anxiously awaiting what comes next . <EOS> On Kabul 's streets , you can easily find the uneasy legacy of America 's longest war . <EOS> Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day 's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon : they speak English . <EOS> Now however , their world has turned upon them . <EOS> They were , each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted , they say , meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or NGOs here . <EOS> The skill they once thrived off has left them isolated , and fearing reprisals . <EOS> They sleep in market stalls , and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them . <EOS> `` My family is still living in the provinces , '' one of the men tells me . <EOS> `` I can not go there . <EOS> I am living in a market , in one of the empty shops . '' <EOS> Another adds : `` My family , everybody , give up on me , they are nervous . '' <EOS> A third man -- all requested anonymity -- says : `` Right now I sleep here , on the street , in this mosque area . '' <EOS> `` We are in prison in Afghanistan , '' a fourth says . <EOS> The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment for this story . <EOS> EXCLUSIVE : The last Americans in Afghanistan Helicopters still buzz around the capital . <EOS> Its population is five times what it was when NATO arrived here , even by the most conservative estimates , and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in Kabul 's dusty , mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting . <EOS> Neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in `` poppy palaces '' -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty . <EOS> One road , forever pot-holed in the past decade , is now being covered over by Afghans who , it seems , are finally reclaiming that street . <EOS> Even Chicken Street , the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets , is more or less deserted . <EOS> One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now . <EOS> It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers . <EOS> They are now empty , the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables . <EOS> It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there . <EOS> Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps , holding their children , hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America 's war here . <EOS> Huge lines of excavators , cherry-pickers , and forklift trucks sit idle . <EOS> At times it seemed there was little America would n't do , or try , to meets its often fluid goals in the country . <EOS> Yet today , the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust . <EOS> EXCLUSIVE : Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here . <EOS> Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered . <EOS> Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases . <EOS> Now the bases are gone , and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still . <EOS> Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings , yet the drivers have been left behind , stuck with vehicles that cost them $ 30,000 to buy -- and $ 1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now . <EOS> `` The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai , '' one truck driver tells us . <EOS> Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate . <EOS> Along one stretch of road their endless , multiplying lights throb . <EOS> Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here , despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving . <EOS> One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai . <EOS> The city 's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here . <EOS> NATO 's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on . <EOS> The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow . <EOS> READ MORE : Nick Paton Walsh answers your questions about Afghanistan
-LRB- CNN -RRB- An internal inquiry by the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office in 2009 concluded that Reserve Deputy Robert Bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency . <EOS> Bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect Eric Harris instead of stunning him with a Taser on April 2 . <EOS> A Harris family lawyer provided documents to CNN from the 2009 inquiry , which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of Bates . <EOS> The Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office has not responded to repeated calls for comment from CNN . <EOS> An attorney for Bates , Clark O. Brewster , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper on Friday that he disputed the findings in the report and maintained that his client had the proper training . <EOS> Bates , 73 , is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of Harris . <EOS> He pleaded not guilty . <EOS> Bates was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Harris in a weapons sting operation . <EOS> Bates has said he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead . <EOS> Bates has said the shooting was accidental . <EOS> He has apologized to the Harris family , as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz . <EOS> How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser ? <EOS> The attorney for the Harris family said that Bates was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff . <EOS> The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office were told to forge Bates ' records and were reassigned when they refused . <EOS> The sheriff 's office denied the allegations in the newspaper 's report . <EOS> It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims . <EOS> Over the weekend , one of Bates ' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training . <EOS> However , the records were incomplete . <EOS> Bates ' attorney , Brewster , characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers . <EOS> The allegations made in the report are the result of misunderstandings and misstatements , he said . <EOS> The memos obtained by CNN show that a `` special investigation '' was launched in July 2009 at the request of then-Undersheriff Brian Edwards . <EOS> Edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically : Was Bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies , and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid Bates ? <EOS> The investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that Bates had not completed . <EOS> Police caught on camera : The good and the bad On Friday , the Tulsa County district attorney 's office said it had received new information -- likely the 2009 memo -- that `` are worthy of further investigation beyond the scope of the manslaughter case . '' <EOS> The DA 's office is reaching out to independent law enforcement agencies to investigate further . <EOS> Contrary to claims by the sheriff 's office that Bates had the required training to be in the field , the 2009 memo indicates otherwise . <EOS> The document names then-Chief Deputy Tim Albin -LRB- currently undersheriff -RRB- and then-Capt . <EOS> Tom Huckeby -LRB- now a major -RRB- as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower-ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for Bates . <EOS> One deputy reported that he was tasked with providing field training for Bates . <EOS> The written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training , but that Huckeby and Albin pressured the trainer to write that Bates was qualified after only 320 hours . <EOS> The trainer , fearing reassignment if he did not comply , signed a memo stating that Bates had completed 328 hours of training , and did not elaborate on details of the training . <EOS> Later , the memo was amended by his superiors to read , in part , that Bates was `` capable of performing the functions of a patrol deputy . '' <EOS> The training deputy said he initialed the changes , even though he did n't think Bates was properly trained . <EOS> According to the investigation memo , the trainer said that if he was honest , he would have said Bates needed remedial training , and that the reserve deputy was `` not really good at traffic stops or operations . '' <EOS> The internal investigation only turned up 72 hours of documented training . <EOS> The trainer maintained that he oversaw 328 hours of training , but that the records were sent not to the records office , but instead to Huckeby . <EOS> Brewster denied the claims made by the trainer , and alleged that trainer lost his job in part because of his conduct during the internal inquiry . <EOS> Another deputy said that she signed a driving certificate for Bates , even though she believed he had not completed the training . <EOS> Albin asked the deputy to make the certificate , and she did so without questioning him , according to the investigation . <EOS> The memo lists other instances where Bates performed operations that he was n't supposed to , given his stature in the department , but that complaints by other officers were dismissed by supervisors . <EOS> Those who complained about Bates , according to the memo , were told to leave him alone or to make an exception , citing that he did a lot of good for the county and was close with the top leaders in the agency .
Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- Former rap mogul Marion `` Suge '' Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton '' earlier this year . <EOS> In addition to that ruling , Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive . <EOS> The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight . <EOS> In all , Knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run , the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday . <EOS> Knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted . <EOS> Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment . <EOS> Knight was in court Thursday . <EOS> At the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom . <EOS> In a press conference after the hearing , fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight 's health that he is `` doing much better . '' <EOS> The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle Knight was driving , is used against several people . <EOS> Knight is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument . <EOS> Killed was Terry Carter , 55 . <EOS> The survivor is Cle Sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends Knight to prison , according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA . <EOS> Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday , the affiliates reported . <EOS> The deadly incident happened on January 29 , after a flare-up on the set of the biopic `` Straight Outta Compton , '' a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. . <EOS> The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam 's Burgers in Compton . <EOS> At the time , Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case . <EOS> The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck . <EOS> In the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant , and he is then approached by Sloan , who was working security on the site . <EOS> The two men appear to talk for a few moments , with Knight still in his vehicle . <EOS> Suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking Sloan to the ground . <EOS> While still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera . <EOS> The vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over Sloan a second time , and then running over a second man , Carter , a former rap music label owner . <EOS> Carter later died . <EOS> In closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , Knight 's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim . <EOS> Knight was only defending himself against Sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . <EOS> `` Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor , '' Knight 's attorney argued . <EOS> `` There 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive . '' <EOS> `` Even without a gun , we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , '' the defense attorney said . <EOS> Fletcher added that Knight 's defense was to stand his ground . <EOS> Sloan `` needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , '' Fletcher said . <EOS> `` He is the person who got Terry -LRB- Carter -RRB- killed . '' <EOS> Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued , however , told the judge that Knight was engaged in `` mutual combat situation '' where he used his car as deadly weapon . <EOS> If Knight `` ever had the right of self-defense , the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over , he lost the right of self-defense , '' Barnes said . <EOS> `` There was pre-mediation and intent when he -LRB- Knight -RRB- ran over him a second time . '' <EOS> Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30 . <EOS> The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight , who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg -LRB- now known as Snoop Lion -RRB- and Tupac Shakur . <EOS> Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996 . <EOS> Shortly afterward , Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions . <EOS> That prison time -- along with Shakur 's death , feuds between Knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by Dr. Dre , Snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006 . <EOS> In August , Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- `` Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , '' Jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables . <EOS> It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise . <EOS> Meanwhile , Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support . <EOS> So how did this wandering band of first-century evangelists support themselves ? <EOS> Clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation . <EOS> In the New Testament , money gets 37 mentions , while `` gold '' gets 38 citations , `` silver '' merits 20 , and `` copper '' four . <EOS> `` Coin '' comes up eight times , and `` purse '' and `` denarii '' -- the Roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals . <EOS> Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the New Testament : As the Gospel of John tells it , six days before Passover , Jesus was in Bethany at the house of his friend Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead . <EOS> A woman named Mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining Jesus . <EOS> She dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists . <EOS> Judas Iscariot objected to the act . <EOS> `` Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? '' <EOS> Judas asks . <EOS> Though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , Jesus told Judas to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , `` you always have the poor with you '' -- but Jesus would not always be there . <EOS> What that passage makes clear is that the Jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive . <EOS> So how much ? <EOS> `` I imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level , '' Rabbi Joshua Garroway , a professor of Early Christianity and the Second Commonwealth at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles . <EOS> Jesus and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes . <EOS> They ate what they caught or what others shared . <EOS> `` I venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of Jesus and the companions with whom he traveled , '' Garroway said . <EOS> Garroway said that it was possible , even likely , that Jesus and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth . <EOS> The Gospel of Luke gives us a glimpse of how Jesus ' ministry functioned on a practical level : `` Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God . <EOS> The twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , and Joanna , the wife of Herod 's steward Chuza , and Susanna , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources . '' <EOS> So , according to Luke , women whom Jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their `` resources , '' with Mary Magdalene and Joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of Jesus . <EOS> Joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of Herod Antipas , the son of Herod the Great , the violent and ambitious head of Judea . <EOS> As part of this volatile but powerful household , Joanna would be uniquely positioned to help Jesus with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections . <EOS> She attends to him during his life , and , the Gospels tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty . <EOS> With her on that morning is Mary Magdalene , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of Jesus . <EOS> Mary likely came from the prosperous town of Magdala , on the Sea of Galilee . <EOS> As home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , Mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself . <EOS> Mary Magdalene was free to travel the country with Jesus and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in `` Finding Jesus '' we examine the Gnostic gospel of Mary Magdalene and explore the argument that Jesus was , in fact , her husband . <EOS> She may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger . <EOS> Not only was Mary Magdalene one of Jesus ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from Galilee to Jerusalem , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said Mark Goodacre , a professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Duke University . <EOS> When the Gospels speak of her `` ministering '' to Jesus , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in Jesus ' everyday mission , Goodacre continues . <EOS> Along with other women like Joanna and Susanna , she was one of those who made his mission viable . <EOS> Along with these women , men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund Jesus ' ministry . <EOS> The Gospels reveal that both these men were rich , and supported Jesus -- indeed , it was Joseph who removed Jesus from the cross on Good Friday , anointing his body with the help of Nicodemus , and placing him in the tomb that Joseph had reserved for himself . <EOS> After the resurrection on that first Easter Sunday , the movement Jesus started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater . <EOS> Michael McKinley is co-author , with David Gibson , of `` Finding Jesus : Faith . <EOS> Fact . <EOS> Forgery. : Six Holy Objects That Tell the Remarkable Story of the Gospels .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- As Americans mark the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to Illinois . <EOS> Lincoln 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his Midwestern roots . <EOS> He knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton . <EOS> The entire region from the Appalachians to the Rockies drained through the Mississippi River , enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through New Orleans and from there to the world . <EOS> He thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular , or Dixie more generally . <EOS> The U.S. landmass , he insisted , `` is well adapted to be the home of one national family ; and it is not well adapted for two , or more '' because `` there is no line , straight or crooked , suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide . '' <EOS> Lincoln supplemented his Midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly Midwestern claim about constitutional history : `` The Union is older than any of the States ; and in fact , it created them as States . '' <EOS> Lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case , and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the Constitution 's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession . <EOS> The Constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says . <EOS> But Lincoln 's additional assertion that the Union created the states , not vice versa , provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country . <EOS> Most Virginians , including Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee , insisted that of course Virginia had come first ! <EOS> At the outbreak of the American Revolution , the Old Dominion was already a century and a half old . <EOS> Generations of Lees had helped govern Virginia long before the United States was born . <EOS> But if Lee was , first and always , a Virginian , Lincoln was an American . <EOS> His father came from Virginia , his grandfather hailed from Pennsylvania , and before that , the family had probably lived in New England . <EOS> Abe himself had been born in Kentucky and had moved as a boy to Indiana , and later , as a young man , to Illinois . <EOS> These latter two Midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the Union itself . <EOS> These places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all Americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life . <EOS> When young Abe moved to Indiana , it was just becoming a state , thanks to federal governmental action . <EOS> It was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the Lincolns and countless other Kentuckians to leave the Bluegrass State for a brighter future in the Midwest . <EOS> Retracing Lincoln 's assassination 150 years later That brighter future also involved freedom from slavery . <EOS> The Old Northwest had always been free soil , as provided for by a Northwest Ordinance that predated the U.S. Constitution . <EOS> The words of the 13th Amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that Lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in America and did so by borrowing verbatim from Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance . <EOS> True , geography is not inexorable destiny . <EOS> Many other Midwesterners in Lincoln 's era embraced slavery and secession . <EOS> Hugo Black , the Supreme Court justice who did the most to make Lincoln 's constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in Alabama . <EOS> But geographic variation has always been a large part of America 's constitutional saga . <EOS> In the 1860 election that brought him to power , Lincoln swept almost all the Northern states , but did miserably in the slaveholding south . <EOS> John Wilkes Booth , the dastard who ended Lincoln 's life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state . <EOS> So was Lincoln 's nemesis on the Supreme Court , Chief Justice Roger Taney . <EOS> Taney 's most infamous ruling , the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision in 1857 , had emerged from a court dominated by the South ; although slave states accounted for less a third of America 's free population , this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court . <EOS> Remembering Lincoln 's murder In our era , given the fact that Republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate . <EOS> Much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern Republicans on the Court -- most notably , Minnesota 's Harry Blackmun , Illinois ' John Paul Stevens , and New Hampshire 's David Souter . <EOS> All nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal New England , at Harvard or Yale , and the Republican appointee most attentive to gay rights , Anthony Kennedy , grew up in northern California , a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles . <EOS> Which takes us back to Lincoln . <EOS> When Anthony Kennedy was a lad in California 's state capital , the governor , a friend of the Kennedy family , was a Lincoln Republican named Earl Warren -- a man who would later author the Court 's iconic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education , vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by Lincoln and his allies . <EOS> Today , both parties at their best claim Lincoln . <EOS> Jeb Bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and Rand Paul is a Kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach . <EOS> Hillary Clinton was born an Illinois Republican . <EOS> And the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from Illinois who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating Lincoln 's geographic coalition , winning every state within a four-hour drive of Chicago . <EOS> In the largest sense , then , all Americans , of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in Illinois -- are living in the Land of Lincoln .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- I 'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer . <EOS> What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body . <EOS> I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement . <EOS> If not for the video taken by a bystander , I ca n't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation . <EOS> As a defense attorney , I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime , but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation . <EOS> Thank God there was a camera . <EOS> It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case . <EOS> However , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera . <EOS> Throughout the entire encounter with Scott , it 's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him . <EOS> Had he known there would be video of his every move , would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man ? <EOS> Would he have fired ? <EOS> Eight times ? <EOS> Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report ? <EOS> Of course not . <EOS> If Slager had been wearing a body camera , Scott would probably still be alive , and Slager would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence . <EOS> Body cameras are expensive to deploy , sure . <EOS> And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more . <EOS> That cost , however -- if we 're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott 's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department . <EOS> Most importantly , we have to ask ourselves this : What 's the value of a human life ? <EOS> Certainly it 's worth the price of some mass data storage . <EOS> And there 's something else at stake . <EOS> The public is losing confidence in law enforcement , and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point . <EOS> Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street . <EOS> As fear ratchets up , so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve . <EOS> As tension rises , the risk of more shootings increases . <EOS> It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos . <EOS> Police body cameras can help break this cycle . <EOS> Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera . <EOS> Complaints against cops decrease , and , most importantly , use-of-force incidents drop . <EOS> I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution . <EOS> They only help compensate for the real underlying problem , which is this : There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system , and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men . <EOS> When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver 's license -- it 's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive . <EOS> These may not be overtly racist cops . <EOS> They may not intentionally treat black men differently , but we ca n't pretend that black men are n't being disproportionately targeted . <EOS> All across the country , we see it happening , and with the proliferation of video , we 're seeing it happen with alarming frequency . <EOS> Somehow , we 're going to have to beat this bias out of our system . <EOS> Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops . <EOS> Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it . <EOS> As a society , we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income , education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation . <EOS> But social change , sadly , may take generations of hard work . <EOS> In the meantime , if we ca n't immediately root out racial bias , we can at least put a bright spotlight on it , and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- On Tuesday , a white police officer in North Charleston , South Carolina , was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back . <EOS> Officer Michael Slager was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at Walter Scott as Scott ran away from a traffic stop . <EOS> The video footage contradicts Slager 's statement that he felt threatened after Scott allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle . <EOS> The Post and Courier reported that the FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the State Law Enforcement Division , while the South Carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations . <EOS> Now , after watching the footage which should remain in your memory for a long time to come one could say that Slager shot Scott like a dog . <EOS> But then again , dogs usually are not treated this badly . <EOS> But the man was shot like a runaway slave . <EOS> In this case , there was clear documented evidence of what occurred , and no room for fabrications . <EOS> Most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable . <EOS> The police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death , or like Slager , apparently place a Taser near Scott 's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger . <EOS> `` We ca n't bring Mr. Scott back , but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with Mr. Scott . <EOS> Because what happened today does n't happen all the time , '' said L. Chris Stewart , an attorney for the Scott family , at a press conference . <EOS> `` I do n't think that all police officers are bad cops , but there are some bad ones out there . <EOS> And I do n't want to see anyone get shot down the way that my brother got shot down , '' said Anthony Scott , brother of the victim . <EOS> `` What if there was no video ? <EOS> What if there was no witness , or hero as I call him , to come forward ? <EOS> Then this would n't have happened , because as you can see , the initial reports stated something totally different . <EOS> The officer said that Mr. Scott attacked him and pulled his Taser and tried to use it on him . <EOS> But somebody was watching , '' Stewart added . <EOS> `` After watching the video , the senseless shooting and taking of #WalterScott 's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable , '' tweeted Sen. Tim Scott . <EOS> `` My heart aches for the family and our North Charleston community . <EOS> I will be watching this case closely . '' <EOS> Although the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality , through personal experience and anecdotes , the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue . <EOS> A ProPublica analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males . <EOS> And 67 % of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black . <EOS> Of the whites who are killed by cops , 91 % are killed by white cops . <EOS> Sixty-eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers . <EOS> Furthermore , 10 % of police involved in fatal shootings are black , and 78 % of the people killed by black officers are black . <EOS> According to Cynthia Lee of George Washington University Law School , the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police . <EOS> Racial stereotypes , Lee argues , subconsciously influence an officer 's decision on whether to use deadly force , even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race . <EOS> A simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer 's authority . <EOS> What 's more , a Washington State University study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects , suggesting participants `` held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats . '' <EOS> Scott is the latest in a long line of black bodies , from Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , and Eric Garner in Staten Island , to John Crawford III near Dayton , Ohio , and Tanisha Anderson and Tamir Rice in Cleveland . <EOS> In this case , the bystander video of Scott 's killing and the cover-up of the crime by Slager made the difference . <EOS> Otherwise , the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed . <EOS> What happened in North Charleston tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died . <EOS> And yet , the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner . <EOS> The taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in America that must be addressed , because #BlackLivesMatter . <EOS> May Walter Scott rest in peace . <EOS> The arrest and charging of Officer Michael Slager is a rare event that must be celebrated for the small victory that it is , in the midst of unspeakable tragedy . <EOS> But this is by no means over .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- If I had to describe the U.S.-Iranian relationship in one word it would be `` overmatched . '' <EOS> We 're playing checkers on the Middle East game board and Tehran 's playing three-dimensional chess . <EOS> Iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that America 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track . <EOS> Iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce Iran 's power , the United States is only making Tehran taller . <EOS> Consider the following : The U.S.-Iranian relationship is not symmetrical . <EOS> It 's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors . <EOS> Iran is about to try a U.S. citizen and Washington Post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from Iran 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its Shia militias in Iraq . <EOS> I can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind-the-scenes plan to have Iran release Jason Rezaian . <EOS> If not , we 're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising U.S. values and interests in the process by not ensuring that all Americans being held by Iran come out as part of the nuclear deal . <EOS> America is alienating some of our closest allies because of the Iran deal , and Iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see Iran 's power rising . <EOS> Our friends are n't perfect , particularly the Saudis and even the Israelis . <EOS> But we need them precisely because Iran is rising . <EOS> Sadly , the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities . <EOS> In the meantime , Iran 's allies , Bashar al-Assad 's Syria , Hezbollah and now the Houthis -- not proxies , but instruments of convenience -- see what 's happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the Iranian game . <EOS> The Russians , too , realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency . <EOS> We 're losing friends ; Iran is gaining them . <EOS> And in one of the cruelest ironies , Iran 's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah : the nuclear issue . <EOS> As the Arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power , -LRB- Egypt , Iraq , Syria -RRB- , Iran is rising . <EOS> The argument here is not that Iran is taking over the Middle East . <EOS> But in its zone of influence , a zone critical to the United States -- Syria , Iraq , the Gulf , Yemen , Lebanon -- it is expanding its influence , not contracting . <EOS> Washington does n't play this kind of game well . <EOS> It is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat ISIS in Syria and yet not empower al-Assad -LRB- no answer -RRB- , how to combat ISIS in Iraq without favoring the Shia-dominated government and alienating Iraqi Sunnis -LRB- no answer -RRB- and how to backstop the Saudis in Yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes -LRB- no answer -RRB- . <EOS> Iran has a much easier time managing contradictions . <EOS> Indeed , it can use the threat of ISIS to keep the Americans away from weakening their ally al-Assad as well as expand its influence in Iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest . <EOS> Battle group naval assets to the Gulf of Aden notwithstanding , the United States is being outfoxed , not outgunned . <EOS> Do n't expect U.S. ships to stop those of Iran . <EOS> As State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said , `` There are reports about these U.S. ships that have been moved and I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression . <EOS> They are not there to intercept Iranian ships . <EOS> The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe . <EOS> I think there was some misreporting and confusion on this . <EOS> I just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those Iranian ships . '' <EOS> It clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain Iran 's nuclear program . <EOS> But we should have no illusions about two things . <EOS> First , we wo n't end Teheran 's nuclear weapons pretensions , and two , we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy , not constraining it . <EOS> One of the reasons the United States wo n't strike al-Assad is for fear of emboldening ISIS , but the other is that we do n't want a proxy war with Iran in Syria . <EOS> As the Russians have made clear in their recent S-300 deal , the nuclear negotiations are only making Iran a more acceptable business partner . <EOS> And the real fruits of the diplomacy have n't even begun yet . <EOS> Sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up , not tamp down , their regional aspirations . <EOS> We 've made our bed , apparently , and now are going to have to find a way to sleep . <EOS> A nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now . <EOS> But unless it really does change Iran 's behavior , we 've only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- On Thursday , NPR -- headquartered in Washington , just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody . <EOS> Unfortunately , while it was a freshly produced segment , it was hardly a new story . <EOS> Titled `` Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians , '' the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal `` what 's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , '' going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans `` targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction . '' <EOS> A similar claim was made after Ferguson 's uprising in August of last year . <EOS> Indeed , it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s , the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness . <EOS> Yes , interethnic tensions continue to exist , though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks . <EOS> And yes , this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides . <EOS> But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there 's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus . <EOS> Instead , it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods . <EOS> In other words , they were collateral damage , along with other stores in the vicinity of riots . <EOS> So it 's time to call this persistent meme what it is : A misleading , hyperbolic and dangerous distraction , one that shifts blame away from the real issues . <EOS> As Jennifer Lee , sociology professor at University of California , Irvine , and author of the 2002 book `` Civility in the City : Blacks , Jews and Koreans in Urban America , '' notes , `` the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor , disadvantaged communities . <EOS> By directing our attention to interminority conflict , it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems . '' <EOS> Let 's be honest . <EOS> There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences . <EOS> There 's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures . <EOS> For example , in 1993 , the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee , a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University , and the subsequent acquittal of his killer , was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities . <EOS> But things are different now . <EOS> Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans , patterns of immigration have shifted . <EOS> Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia , the Middle East and Africa . <EOS> The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted . <EOS> Among merchants , there 's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread , surviving or failing together . <EOS> For decades , black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities . <EOS> For example , the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland , founded in 1995 , has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore 's police , while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents . <EOS> A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve . <EOS> These are n't the kind of stories you 'll hear in the media . <EOS> It 's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long , hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities . <EOS> Back in 1995 , the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee , owners of Lee 's Food Market in the West Baltimore 's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension . <EOS> The story highlighted the Lees ' openness to the community , their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity , which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year . <EOS> I spoke with Eun Ja Lee , calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees ' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday . <EOS> Were they open ? <EOS> Were they safe ? <EOS> `` Oh , of course we 're open , we 're always open ! '' <EOS> said Mrs. Lee , warmly and brightly . <EOS> `` This week , many customers came in and said to me ` Mrs. Lee , do n't worry you are part of our community , you are our family . <EOS> We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open ! ' <EOS> We love it . <EOS> We love it . '' <EOS> And yet , no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market , nor have they talked with her customers , stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage . <EOS> Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat , but not light . <EOS> There 's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations , one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told , not buried under cliches and clickbait .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Iran will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deal 's implementation , President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday . <EOS> Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Islamic republic 's supreme leader , meanwhile , told state-run media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it is n't final , and he 's not certain it will become binding because he has `` never been optimistic about negotiations with the U.S. '' Six world powers and Iran reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit Tehran 's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions . <EOS> The United States , however , has stressed that if a final deal is reached with Iran , the removal of any sanctions will come in phases . <EOS> But work on the agreement is n't finished . <EOS> Negotiators from Iran and the United States , China , Germany , France , Britain and Russia have until June 30 to come up with a final deal . <EOS> Khamenei said he supports the negotiators , but in several not-so-subtle shots at the United States , noted it is too soon to celebrate the proposed deal . <EOS> `` Everything lies in the details , '' Khamenei said in a Thursday address , according to Press TV . <EOS> `` The other side , which is known for backpedaling on its commitments , may want to corner our country when it comes to the specifics . '' <EOS> What has been hashed out so far is no guarantee that the deal will become final , he said , and according to the Islamic Republic News Agency , the leader said he ca n't support or oppose the deal , especially when it 's possible `` the other disloyal party intends to limit our country . '' <EOS> Some have asked why Khamenei has n't taken a position on the talks , and the reason is simple , he said , according to IRNA : `` There is no need to take a position . <EOS> Officials say nothing has been done yet and that nothing is binding . <EOS> I am neither in favor nor against it . '' <EOS> Any final deal must `` ensure the interests and dignity of the -LRB- Iranian -RRB- nation , '' he said , adding he will support an agreement that `` will safeguard national interests and dignity . '' <EOS> He said he 'd rather see the agreement fail than make a deal that jeopardizes Iran 's interests . <EOS> `` What has happened so far will neither guarantee the agreement itself nor its content . <EOS> It will not even guarantee completion of the negotiations . <EOS> Therefore , it is meaningless to congratulate me or others about it , '' he said . <EOS> Rouhani said his government would not surrender to bullying , sanctions and threats , according to Press TV . <EOS> `` We will not sign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all economic sanctions against Iran are lifted all at once , '' Rouhani said at a ceremony to mark National Nuclear Technology Day in Tehran . <EOS> President Barack Obama faces an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical Congress , which has threatened to impose new sanctions on Iran . <EOS> U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz , a nuclear physicist and negotiator with Iran , estimated it would take six months after a final deal is signed for the sanctions to be lifted . <EOS> He told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour that it was a `` ballpark '' figure contingent on a lot of work the Iranians will have to do beforehand . <EOS> `` The core nuclear provisions must be satisfied ... the provisions that give us our confidence , '' Moniz said . <EOS> He said it 's in the `` hands of the Iranians '' to fulfill steps such as reducing stockpiles and lowering the number of operating centrifuges . <EOS> `` It will depend on their ability to execute those moves , '' Moniz said . <EOS> Asked if the Iranians were aware of that time frame during the negotiations -- before Rouhani called for the immediate lifting of sanctions -- Moniz said , `` Oh , yes , for sure . '' <EOS> The No. 3 House Republican leader said a bill to ease any sanctions does not stand much of a chance in the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate . <EOS> `` The sanctions that were put in place -- again , very bipartisan sanctions passed by Congress years ago that were effective -- the only way to get rid of them completely would be for Congress to vote to ease those sanctions , '' Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana said in a radio interview with WWL in New Orleans on Wednesday . <EOS> `` We have n't had that vote . <EOS> I do n't see that passing out of the House . <EOS> I do n't even think it would pass out of the Senate right now . '' <EOS> Diplomats announced last week that they 'd come up with the framework for an agreement after a marathon stretch of late-night negotiations in Lausanne , Switzerland . <EOS> The framework includes the easing of U.S. and U.N. sanctions on Iran if it takes certain steps to curb its nuclear program . <EOS> Iran would reduce its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 % for 15 years and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges , according to the plan . <EOS> In exchange , the United States and the European Union would lift sanctions that have crippled the country 's economy . <EOS> `` It is a good deal , a deal that meets our core objectives , '' Obama said after it was announced April 2 . <EOS> `` This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon . '' <EOS> It would include strict verification measures to make sure Iran complies , he said . <EOS> The United States and Iran have a long history of strained relations , which made the negotiations more significant . <EOS> Just two years ago , the two countries had not talked with each other officially in nearly four decades . <EOS> CNN 's Eliott C. McLaughlin , Christine Theodorou and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- They were huddled in the back of a tugboat . <EOS> Some were without shoes . <EOS> Their coats and jackets , still wet , were piled up in a huge container behind them . <EOS> The 117 migrants , mostly from sub-Saharan Africa , arrived in the port of Augusta , Sicily , around 1p . <EOS> m. Tuesday , after being picked up by the tugboat off the coast of Libya . <EOS> The two boats they had been in were barely seaworthy , the tug 's Montenegrin captain told me . <EOS> The discarded coats , he said , would be thrown away . <EOS> We had flown to Sicily from Rome following news that as many as 400 migrants had been lost at sea . <EOS> The tragedy adds to the mounting death toll among those fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East . <EOS> So far this year as many as 900 have lost their lives . <EOS> Last year at least 3,200 died making the journey . <EOS> Since 2000 , according to the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- , almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean . <EOS> Thousands may have died , but even more have succeeded in making the treacherous journey . <EOS> This small group in Augusta were among nearly 10,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores since the weekend , according to the Italian Coast Guard . <EOS> With the onset of spring and calmer seas , it appears that the flow of migrants is not relenting . <EOS> The group , which included 31 women , was composed mostly of Nigerians and Gambians . <EOS> As they filed off the boat , representatives of the Italian Red Cross did a quick visual inspection , checking for fever , scabies , any sign of illness . <EOS> One woman , they discovered , was two months pregnant . <EOS> Timothy , in his mid-20s from Nigeria , told me he left his home nine months ago . <EOS> He paid human traffickers in Tripoli 1,000 Libyan dinars , more than $ 700 , for the voyage . <EOS> For him , it 's a fortune . <EOS> I asked 28-year-old Jibril , from Gambia , why he had left his home . <EOS> `` It 's not like in Europe , '' he told me . <EOS> `` After 20 , 25 years , you have to make a future for yourself . <EOS> But in Gambia , I could n't . <EOS> My family , they do n't have nothing . <EOS> They are poor people . '' <EOS> Mercy , from Kano in northern Nigeria , seemed shell-shocked . <EOS> In a faint voice she told me she had left Kano because her family feared she that would be taken by Boko Haram . <EOS> `` I was scared , '' 25-year-old Al-Haji from Gambia told me about the journey from Libya . <EOS> `` I was taking a big risk . <EOS> Either I enter Europe or I die . '' <EOS> Another man , from Liberia , told me he had lived and worked in Libya for 15 years , but was terrified at the prospect of ISIS gaining even more territory . <EOS> An Egyptian translator working for the Italian police told me they had information that a large group of Syrians were gathered in a Tripoli warehouse , and were expected to make the journey to Italy in the coming days . <EOS> It seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of Africa and the Middle East -- grinding poverty , war and the rise of ISIS -- are washing up on the shores of Italy . <EOS> The wars , unrest , upheaval , misery and injustice I 've covered over the last 20 years , in Syria , in Libya , in West Africa and elsewhere , seem to be coming together to remind those who have enjoyed Europe 's relative peace and prosperity that no man is an island . <EOS> The small group of migrants in Augusta has been taken in by the Italian authorities . <EOS> They 've been fed , clothed , received medical treatment , and will be taken to migrant camp in northern Italy . <EOS> Most will then try move further north , to countries like France , Belgium , the Netherlands and the UK , where economic opportunities are better than in austerity-wracked Italy . <EOS> Others will stay in Italy , trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars . <EOS> And as they settle in , somehow or other , more and more will come to Italy 's shores .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Robert Downey Jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a British journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie Downey was there to promote . <EOS> The journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and `` dark periods '' of addiction and jail time . <EOS> Twitter , of course , is abuzz : Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far ? <EOS> Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ? <EOS> From the start of the 7-minute television interview , it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , `` Avengers : Age of Ultron . '' <EOS> He grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on-topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug . <EOS> His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than Guru-Murthy , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , `` Do I really have to sit here with this guy ? '' <EOS> At one point , he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous , saying , `` Your foot is starting to jump a little bit . <EOS> You better get to your next question . '' <EOS> But it 's after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is `` free from all of that , '' referring to Downey 's history of `` taking drugs , drinking '' that the building tension comes to a head . <EOS> `` I 'm sorry , '' says Downey , `` What are we doing ? '' <EOS> To which Guru-Murthy replies , `` I 'm just asking questions , '' which indeed was so . <EOS> Downey has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next . <EOS> Instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : He smiles arrogantly , says `` bye ! '' <EOS> and stands up to leave . <EOS> He sure showed him ! <EOS> It 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago . <EOS> Journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job . <EOS> And certainly not every journalist is good at his job . <EOS> But while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business . <EOS> The entertainment industry is about entertaining people . <EOS> As such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched . <EOS> This is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general . <EOS> But when the recognition no longer serves them ? <EOS> Then they want to bemoan it ? <EOS> What Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions . <EOS> That 's what an interview is . <EOS> He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering . <EOS> But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off . <EOS> What the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak . <EOS> After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot . <EOS> He turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , `` You seem okay . <EOS> It 's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here , '' followed by what sounds like , `` and you 're kind of a schmuck . '' <EOS> Downey might not have been `` in the mood '' to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable . <EOS> We all have them . <EOS> And yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad . <EOS> The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job . <EOS> He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being . <EOS> Given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots . <EOS> That he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? <EOS> But it 's still on him .
West of Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- Falih Essawi shouted on the phone as he described his situation . <EOS> From his point of view , ISIS militants might be just hours away from taking the key Iraqi city of Ramadi . <EOS> Fierce fighting has engulfed Ramadi , which lies only about 70 miles -LRB- 113 kilometers -RRB- west of Baghdad and is the capital of Anbar province , Iraq 's Sunni heartland . <EOS> Essawi , the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council , told CNN from inside the city Wednesday that it 's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the ISIS offensive . <EOS> The politician said he was on a front line himself , armed with a machine gun . <EOS> Security was `` collapsing rapidly in the city , '' and he begged the Iraqi government for reinforcements and the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS for air support . <EOS> He stressed that urgent support from the military and security forces is needed to save the city . <EOS> `` This is what we warned Baghdad of what 's going to happen , '' Essawi told CNN by phone , referring to the Iraqi government at the capital . <EOS> `` Where is Baghdad ? <EOS> Where is al-Abadi ? '' <EOS> His plea for help comes the day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to seek more support for the fight against ISIS . <EOS> `` Just Allah knows if we will survive this , '' Essawi said . <EOS> According to the Anbar official , at least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against ISIS on Wednesday . <EOS> The extremist group 's offensive in Ramadi shows its resilience despite months of U.S.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by Iraqi forces in the northern city of Tikrit . <EOS> ISIS fighters have Ramadi under pressure from several angles . <EOS> Essawi said ISIS militants made significant advances Wednesday in three areas east of Ramadi : Albu Soda , Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia , which leads to central Ramadi . <EOS> Later , he said that militants were rolling into the center of Ramadi . <EOS> Over the weekend , the militants seized control of areas north of Ramadi . <EOS> Routes south of the city were taken some months ago . <EOS> That leaves only areas to the west of Ramadi in the hands of government forces , but those positions are under threat , Essawi warned . <EOS> The recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city . <EOS> On Wednesday , some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot . <EOS> People also were fleeing the areas where ISIS was advancing east of Ramadi . <EOS> At least 150,000 people have already fled since Wednesday morning , causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city , according to Essawi . <EOS> A CNN team met with three families that had fled an ISIS assault in the Albu Ghanem area . <EOS> Those families said Iraqi security and military forces withdrew from Albu Ghanem after a battle with ISIS , which took over the area quickly . <EOS> One fleeing Albu Ghanem resident , Abu Ahmed , paused to talk to CNN as he and his family walked east toward Baghdad , crossing a bridge over the Euphrates River . <EOS> He said four ISIS militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof . <EOS> Abu Ahmed said he , his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the ISIS fighters were busy setting things up there . <EOS> He said his family left everything behind . <EOS> His family was using a cart to carry his mother , who could n't walk . <EOS> While talking about the fighters ' takeover of his home , his wife started crying and asked God to help the rest of the families who are stuck in Albu Ghanem . <EOS> Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months . <EOS> ISIS took over parts of the city in the first half of last year , placing it at the heart of a deadly tug of war ever since . <EOS> The U.S. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against ISIS targets near Ramadi in recent weeks . <EOS> `` The coalition has been supporting the fight in Ramadi with airstrikes , and there have been seven airstrikes in Ramadi since Monday , '' Col. Ed Thomas , spokesman for Joint Chiefs Chairman Col. Martin Dempsey , said on Wednesday . <EOS> He stressed that Ramadi remains contested . <EOS> Another U.S. military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told CNN that the fall of Ramadi is `` not imminent . '' <EOS> Sizable parts of the city are under ISIS control or influence , but the area has been a target of a months-long offensive , that official said . <EOS> CNN 's Hamdi Alkhshali and Arwa Damon reported from west of Baghdad , and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong . <EOS> CNN 's Jason Hanna , Jim Sciutto , Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- People have long underestimated the athleticism necessary for golf . <EOS> But over the last decade , with fit golfers like Tiger Woods , Adam Scott , and now Jordan Spieth all winning the Masters , the training perspective on golf is shifting . <EOS> There 's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing , which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers . <EOS> During the Masters , Spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries : mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation . <EOS> Equally important , he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility . <EOS> Related : Yoga for triathletes Remember Tiger Wood 's low-back problem earlier this year ? <EOS> Tiger blamed a lack of glute -LRB- primary buttock muscle -RRB- firing for locking up his back , but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue . <EOS> When golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips , they compensate with their low back and knees , which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury . <EOS> Want the mobility to swing like Spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers ? <EOS> Try these three yoga-based moves I use with my PGA clients to address the key areas of the swing . <EOS> Trains internal hip rotation ; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles ; stretches upper back and shoulders ; encourages ankle mobility Start in a neutral all-fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists . <EOS> Engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back . <EOS> Extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down . <EOS> Exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee , hip or back pain . <EOS> Inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes -LRB- as pictured -RRB- . <EOS> Be sure the rotation is coming from your hip , not your lower back , knees or ankles . <EOS> Exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor . <EOS> Repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side . <EOS> Promotes proper mid-back extension ; strengthens shoulder girdle , opens front of shoulders and chest ; lengthens low back Lie prone -LRB- belly down -RRB- on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders . <EOS> Exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back . <EOS> At the same time , move your shoulder blades down toward your waist . <EOS> This will activate the mid-back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility . <EOS> Hold the posture for three long , deep breaths . <EOS> Rest for a breath or two and repeat for a total of three holds . <EOS> Promotes thoracic spine rotation and shoulder girdle function ; stabilizes low back ; activates glutes -LRB- primary muscles of the buttocks -RRB- ; encourages ankle mobility , strengthens adductors -LRB- groins -RRB- , core and legs Stand with your feet together ; your big toes should touch but allow space between your heels to avoid externally rotating your hips . <EOS> Exhale as you sit back into a squat with your hands and forearms together in front of your chest . <EOS> Inhale as you hold the position , ensuring that your low back does n't arch , and your glutes and core are activated for support . <EOS> Exhale as you rotate from your mid back to place your inside elbow on the top or outside of one leg . <EOS> Keep your hips and low back stable . <EOS> Avoid separating your knees or letting one drop forward . <EOS> Inhale as you use your bottom elbow for leverage to reach your top elbow upward while pulling your hands toward the center of your chest . <EOS> Exhale as you focus on dropping your shoulder blades down your back and rotating from your mid back . <EOS> You can look up or downwhatever is comfortable for your neck . <EOS> Hold the twist for two more breaths . <EOS> Repeat on the opposite side . <EOS> As an advanced option , you can hold one of your clubs -LRB- as pictured -RRB- , reaching your top hand up the club during the twist to open your shoulder and chest . <EOS> Adding these yoga-based moves to your workouts will help you develop the mobility for an optimal swing . <EOS> But it 's up to you to add skill to the movement . <EOS> To that end , there are many golf trainers who focus on body mechanics with skill training . <EOS> According to its website , the Titleist Performance Institute -LRB- TPI -RRB- educates instructors on `` how a properly functioning body allows a player to swing a golf club in the most efficient way possible . '' <EOS> So , if you really want to swing like Spieth , you might consider hiring a TPI-certified trainer since the training staff Spieth thanked during his Masters victory speech were all TPI certified .
Garissa , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- First came the gunshots . <EOS> Then the footsteps , as Al-Shabaab militants followed her into her dorm room . <EOS> Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet , covering herself with clothes . <EOS> Her two roommates hid under their beds , until the gunmen called them out . '' <EOS> -LRB- The gunmen -RRB- told them if you do n't know to read to them in the Muslim word , whatever , and then you lie down , '' Cheroitich told CNN . <EOS> `` And then , if you know , you go to the other side . '' <EOS> The 19-year-old student at Kenya 's Garissa University College did n't see what happened next , but she heard more than enough . <EOS> `` They were shooting everywhere , '' she said . <EOS> `` I did n't want to open my eyes . '' <EOS> For the next two days , Cheroitich did n't budge . <EOS> Unable to get to water , she hydrated by drinking body lotion . <EOS> When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done , with 147 dead at the school -- she did n't believe them . <EOS> Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that , finally , it was safe to come out . <EOS> `` I was scared so much , '' she recalled . <EOS> Cheroitich 's survival story , which she recounted to CNN on Saturday , is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa , a town about 90 miles from the Somali border , and throughout Kenya . <EOS> It is all due to Al-Shabaab , the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but has n't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday 's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi 's upscale Westgate Mall . <EOS> Saturday , the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised `` another bloodbath '' in Kenya . <EOS> The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama , the governor of Garissa county . <EOS> `` The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia , they kill Muslims and Somalis , '' Jama said . <EOS> `` They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims . <EOS> That is a tricky way of doing business . '' <EOS> Jama said the militants were `` bent on nothing but destruction '' and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims . <EOS> `` But that is something we need to fight , '' Jama said . <EOS> Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack . <EOS> The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing . <EOS> A large crowd gathered , despite the baking sun and foul stench . <EOS> The truck drove up next to the onlookers , so that they could inspect the bodies . <EOS> Anger seethed in the crowd . <EOS> `` These gunmen , they killed innocent children . <EOS> We want to burn these people , '' one man told CNN . <EOS> Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab , as well as any those who supported them . <EOS> Five arrested in Kenya attack In a nationally televised speech , Kenyatta said the nation 's fight against terrorism `` has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary , harmless people . '' <EOS> Kenyatta condemned `` corruption of the worst and most criminal kind -LRB- when -RRB- Kenyans ... finance , hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab . '' <EOS> `` There is no form of legal penalty , social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve , to the fullest extent , '' the President said . <EOS> Describing Al-Shabaab as an `` existential threat to our republic , '' Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to `` tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible , sovereign and democratic state .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- As goes Walmart , so goes the nation ? <EOS> Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week , warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers . <EOS> But it was the opposition from Walmart , the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape , that perhaps resonated most deeply , providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland . <EOS> Walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . <EOS> Taken together , the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . <EOS> And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice . <EOS> Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who famously called on the GOP to `` be the party of Sam 's Club , not just the country club , '' told CNN that Walmart 's actions `` foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move . '' <EOS> `` The Republican Party will have to better stand for '' ideas on helping the middle class , said Pawlenty , the head of the Financial Services Roundtable , a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry . <EOS> The party 's leaders must be `` willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gays and lesbians . '' <EOS> Walmart , which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas , emerged victorious on Wednesday . <EOS> Hours after the company 's CEO , Doug McMillon , called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . <EOS> Walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . <EOS> In 2004 , the Walmart PAC gave around $ 2 million to Republicans versus less than $ 500,000 to Democrats , according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics . <EOS> That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . <EOS> In 2014 , the PAC spent about $ 1.3 million to support Republicans and around $ 970,000 for Democrats . <EOS> It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart . <EOS> In 2011 , the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity . <EOS> Two years later , the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014 . <EOS> Retail experts say Walmart 's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base , as well as a recognition of the country 's increasingly progressive views of gay equality -LRB- support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59 % , according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll -RRB- . <EOS> `` It 's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position , '' said Dwight Hill , a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle . <EOS> `` But in the world of the largest retailer in the world , that 's very different . '' <EOS> Hill added : Same-sex marriage , `` while divisive , it 's becoming more common place here within the U.S. , and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer . '' <EOS> The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality . <EOS> After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , a Republican , signed his state 's religious freedom bill into law , CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state . <EOS> The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions , including Bill Oesterle , CEO of the business-rating website Angie 's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels . <EOS> Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state 's passage of the religious freedom act . <EOS> NASCAR , scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer , also spoke out against the Indiana law . <EOS> `` What we 're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business , '' said Jason Rahlan , spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign . <EOS> The debate has reached presidential politics . <EOS> National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination . <EOS> Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana 's religious freedom law and Pence , but moderated his tone a few days later . <EOS> The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a `` better '' and `` more consensus-oriented approach . '' <EOS> `` By the end of the week , Indiana will be in the right place , '' Bush said , a reference to Pence 's promise this week to fix his state 's law in light of the widespread backlash . <EOS> Others in the GOP field are digging in . <EOS> Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate , said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law . <EOS> `` I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda , '' Cruz said . <EOS> Meanwhile , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who previously served on Walmart 's board of directors , called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill , saying it would `` permit unfair discrimination '' against the LGBT community . <EOS> Jay Chesshir , CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas , welcomed Hutchinson 's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state 's bill . <EOS> He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies . <EOS> `` When it comes to culture and quality of life , businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that 's its people , '' Chesshir said . <EOS> `` Therefore , when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things , then the business community will again speak and speak loudly .

-LRB- Billboard -RRB- Considering the Academy of Country Music Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night at the Dallas Cowboys stadium , it was bound to be bigger than any previous year 's ACMs . <EOS> Plus , as hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan were quick to point out , everything is bigger in Texas . <EOS> Billboard : 2015 ACM Awards : See All the Photos But bigger is n't always better . <EOS> Here 's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 ACMs . <EOS> The Best Eric Church & Keith Urban provide an opening wallop With a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching , two of country 's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual ACM Awards with a slick joint kickoff performance . <EOS> Eric Church 's `` Pledge Allegiance To The Hag '' was a fine throwback , but Keith Urban 's powerhouse `` Raise 'Em Up '' lived up to its title -- and then some . <EOS> Setting a Guinness World Record Not only was this the ACMs biggest audience ever , but the 2015 ACM Awards brought in the biggest audience for a live TV awards show ever . <EOS> Now that 's how you celebrate half a century . <EOS> Reba McEntire demonstrates how it 's done During a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department , Reba McEntire showed the entire Cowboys stadium -- and many younger singers who do n't have half her energy -- how it 's done . <EOS> Reba is eternal . <EOS> Taylor Swift singing in the audience Whether it was during Eric Church or Martina McBride , T-Swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples . <EOS> Taylor might have gone pop for `` 1989 , '' but she was deep in the heart of Texas for this annual country extravaganza . <EOS> Billboard : 2015 ACM Awards : And the Winners Are ... Garth Brooks ' All-American salute During Brooks ' performance of `` All-American Kid , '' the country giant welcomed a slew of U.S. military representatives into AT&T Stadium , in an emotional moment that put the red , white and blue front and center . <EOS> Brooks ended the performance by saluting the U.S. armed forces `` who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom , '' and also shouted out his home state of Oklahoma , who are grieving 20 years after the Oklahoma City bombing on Sunday . <EOS> A truly classy moment from one of the best ever . <EOS> Taylor Swift 's mom makes an appearance Sure , Andrea Swift 's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of `` Love Story '' and some lovely words about the 25-year-old superstar . <EOS> But the sight of the elder Swift -- just days after Taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night 's most poignant moments . <EOS> Christina Aguilera joins Rascal Flatts Aguilera is far from country , but with a voice as malleable as hers , she can pass for a song or two . <EOS> After singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on Nashville , Xtina joined longtime hitmakers Rascal Flatts for `` Riot '' from their recent album `` Rewind . '' <EOS> Aguilera and Gary LeVox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked . <EOS> Miranda Lambert domination In addition to kicking ass during her `` Mama 's Broken Heart '' / `` Little Red Wagon '' medley , Lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards . <EOS> If there 's one thing the country community loves more than Miranda Lambert , it 's giving Miranda Lambert awards . <EOS> Billboard : Watch Little Big Town Bring Provocative ` Girl Crush ' to ACMs Little Big Town do n't back down Despite some mild controversy over their song `` Girl Crush , '' Little Big Town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show , giving the ACMs one of its more melancholy moments . <EOS> Jason Aldean comes on strong For a night featuring some shaky vocals , Aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the ACMs during a massive medley . <EOS> It 's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you 're watching at home , but it 's fair to assume that 's what happened during his performance . <EOS> The Worst Tony Romo The Dallas Cowboys QB was understandably a little stiff on the mic -LRB- athletes usually are n't the most charismatic public speakers -RRB- but the whole gag with Shelton asking Romo to toss Bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long . <EOS> On the plus side , Bryan caught the pass . <EOS> On the other hand , there was a tired play on words about balls . <EOS> The length Three hours for the 50th ACMs ? <EOS> Sure , why not . <EOS> Three and a half hours ? <EOS> That 's pushing it . <EOS> They could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song , and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks . <EOS> All of the Milestone Awards Taylor Swift was given an extended honor at this year 's ACM Awards , but some of the Milestone Awards -- especially those given to Reba McEntire , Kenny Chesney and George Strait -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting . <EOS> It 's understandable since 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the ACMs , but sometimes , less -LRB- recipients -RRB- is more . <EOS> Steven Tyler 's facial hair See link . <EOS> Twitter calling out Taylor Swift Plenty of country fans went after T-Swizzle on Twitter , berating her for attending the ACMs after `` abandoning '' country music for pop . <EOS> The truth is , Swift has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range . <EOS> She might have moved to pop , but do n't underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her . <EOS> 2015 Billboard . <EOS> All Rights Reserved .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- `` It really depends what you want . <EOS> Boy ? <EOS> Girl ? <EOS> Young ? <EOS> Old ? '' <EOS> The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader . <EOS> After a week of back and forth phone calls , his initial caginess had given way to greed . <EOS> He 'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate . <EOS> `` We can get , '' he said . <EOS> We 'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground . <EOS> We were told he was one of the men running this `` unofficial '' displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps . <EOS> It had all been heartbreakingly simple . <EOS> We 'd asked who had children available to `` foster '' -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children . <EOS> The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries . <EOS> When our colleague want to see them , he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take . <EOS> One , two maybe ? <EOS> He escaped by saying he needed to check with his `` madam '' -- me . <EOS> I called . <EOS> The man picked up and began referring to me as `` sister . '' <EOS> I told him we wanted to know what we 'd need to do , if we decided we did want to `` foster '' the children . <EOS> He told me , `` Sister , Jesus will reward me , '' so the `` fostering '' was free , he said . <EOS> No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children , if I chose to take them , would `` live in my heart . '' <EOS> If I could also then find it `` in my heart '' to donate to those still in the camp , then that would be `` God 's work . '' <EOS> In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers , by the government 's own admission , 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor . <EOS> The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country . <EOS> Paradoxically , the group also rates Nigeria 's anti-trafficking agency , Naptip , as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it 's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations , Nigeria 's north . <EOS> As the insecurity in the region has spiraled , the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks . <EOS> And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers , concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group . <EOS> At the camp where we finally met the man face to face , there was no attempt at subterfuge . <EOS> We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing . <EOS> I could have had one of them , I was told , but because I 'd specified a younger child , they 'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old . <EOS> Did I want to consider an older girl ? <EOS> A 12-year-old maybe ? <EOS> She could look after the 3-year-old , and cook and clean . <EOS> Either way , two girls would be ready tomorrow , he said . <EOS> I could see them then . <EOS> Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate `` donation '' would be in exchange for the children . <EOS> He could n't , he said , bargain for it . <EOS> He then proceeded to do just that , laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $ 200 . <EOS> Laughing again at $ 300 . <EOS> We finally found a figure he did n't find funny -- $ 500 . <EOS> I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we 'd found .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- It was a masterful performance . <EOS> I watched in awe on Thursday as cardiothoracic surgeon and celebrity talk show host Mehmet Oz surfed a gargantuan wave of criticism to shore . <EOS> I should have expected that Dr. Oz would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed `` quack treatments ... for personal financial gain . '' <EOS> And thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round , he may have actually boosted his media empire . <EOS> But he 's increasingly serving himself at a cost to Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Hospital . <EOS> If Dr. Oz was ever going to go down , surely his ship would 've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a Senate subcommittee . <EOS> He was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products , But Sen. Claire McCaskill , chairwoman of the Senate 's Consumer Protection Panel , instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking there 's a quick fix for their expanding waistlines . <EOS> John Oliver subsequently eviscerated Oz on his hit HBO show `` Last Week Tonight . '' <EOS> In a segment that 's now garnered over 6 million YouTube views , Oliver makes quick work of Oz 's claims about `` magic '' green coffee beans , a product that 's now earned a $ 9 million FTC fine for its false marketing claims . <EOS> Despite his utter humiliation , Dr. Oz soldiered on , with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him , and with Harpo Productions and Sony , who co-produce `` The Dr. Oz Show , '' fully behind his program . <EOS> If the U.S. Senate could n't bring him down , what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to Columbia University , where Dr. Oz holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the Department of Surgery and performs his duties at Columbia-affiliated New York Presbyterian Hospital ? <EOS> The doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from Dr. Oz for his now well-established tendency to promote cure-alls more befitting 1915 than 2015 . <EOS> Turnabout is fair play . <EOS> And Oz and his producers responded with alacrity , slicing and dicing his ill-prepared challengers with an investigative segment that would 've made `` Dateline '' proud . <EOS> He and his team score points with me for pointing out the media 's own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved . <EOS> It 's a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight Oz 's critical attitude toward GMO foods , not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot . <EOS> Dr. Oz after all has conducted experiments on his TV audience , apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center . <EOS> He has a propensity to spout laughably definitive statements with little to no scientific support , such as his advice that `` every kid in America ought to be on Omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D from either the sun or a pill '' because this regimen will help them withstand concussions . <EOS> Instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often , Dr. Oz routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter . <EOS> He correctly pointed out that several of the letter 's signatories are GMO industry shills . <EOS> One of the writers campaigned against a California proposition requiring GMO labeling , and one of the bunch even served time for felony Medicaid fraud . <EOS> These characters never stood a chance in tipping the scales against Dr. Oz , but they got their headlines nonetheless . <EOS> Dr. Oz was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers ' right to accurate product labeling . <EOS> When my wife first brought the letter to my attention , I immediately wanted to know whether these were Columbia physicians . <EOS> This whole affair would 've played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against Dr. Oz . <EOS> So far they 've made no demand for his resignation , though some colleagues made their discomfort public in an op-ed for USAToday last week . <EOS> Dr. Oz is well-aware that some colleagues question him , discussing that tension in his Time magazine op-ed . <EOS> He says he does n't expect all physicians to understand his approach to health promotion , where he 's willing to entertain just about everything , even seances . <EOS> The closed , physician-only social network Sermo issued Dr. Oz numerous questions from its membership , none of which Dr. Oz answered . <EOS> They are revelatory of physician attitudes toward him nonetheless . <EOS> One doc asked Dr. Oz how he could keep up with the fast-changing world of cardiothoracic surgery and carry on with his show every weekday . <EOS> Another asked him how he knows so much about so many areas of medicine -- `` Ru board certified n all these areas ? '' . <EOS> Both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians , who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic , and the way the media industry works . <EOS> Dr. Oz 's show does n't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him . <EOS> Let 's take it as a given that not every physician across America , or at Columbia , has to agree with what Dr. Oz says on his program . <EOS> I certainly do n't . <EOS> Does he have the right to say it ? <EOS> Yes , but not without challenge . <EOS> A real case can be made that Dr. Oz has used his media megaphone to do harm as well as good . <EOS> He is now a polarizing figure , and while Columbia University should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff , the equation with Dr. Oz is becoming increasingly complex . <EOS> He 's no longer simply good PR for the University and New York Presbyterian Hospital , which is often featured in his show . <EOS> The letter writers were correct about one thing : Columbia 's reputation is now linked with the Big Kahuna standing right out in front .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- So now the real trial is underway : What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , deserve and why ? <EOS> What 's he likely to get and why ? <EOS> Let 's start where the penalty phase starts , with the prosecution 's case . <EOS> Prosecutors have listed , as they must , the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment . <EOS> The killing was `` heinous , cruel and depraved . '' <EOS> He placed a bomb in a crowd , set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that 's not heinous , cruel and depraved , what is ? <EOS> Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims , or , at the opposite extreme , it reflects a cold , callous indifference . <EOS> Tsarnaev displayed both . <EOS> Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst . <EOS> The number of dead from the bombing -LRB- three -RRB- and injured -LRB- 260 -RRB- , including dozens maimed , also elevate these murders . <EOS> The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard . <EOS> For 2,500 years , we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable , yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy , and those who prey on them as especially culpable . <EOS> The prosecution 's emphasis : The killings involved `` substantial planning and premeditation '' and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship . <EOS> And then there 's the selection of the site , the Boston Marathon , an `` iconic '' event . <EOS> And then there 's Tsarnaev 's lack of remorse -- opening day , the prosecutor 's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up , giving the security camera the finger . <EOS> From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day , the message has been : Screw you , society . <EOS> Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy , but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse . <EOS> And do n't confuse regret with remorse . <EOS> No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament , regrets the negative publicity he 's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape . <EOS> But that 's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he 's killed and maimed . <EOS> Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils , the defense will insist over and over . <EOS> Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother 's malicious intent . <EOS> As the prisoners inside Washington D.C. 's now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me : No snitching , but if someone dies , then `` the dead guy did everything . '' <EOS> So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be . <EOS> After all , he was only 19 . <EOS> Biologists teach us our brains do n't fully develop until we 're 25 . <EOS> Thus , their argument goes , a 19-year-old simply ca n't be the worst of the worst . <EOS> In 2005 , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed , repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott . <EOS> But in the same article , these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an `` open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults . '' <EOS> And they were talking about 17-year-olds . <EOS> To the best of my knowledge , science has not and can not establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility . <EOS> Think about it : When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building , risking his life to save children inside , we celebrate this heroism . <EOS> We do not , nor should we , dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality . <EOS> If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults , why ca n't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst ? <EOS> What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case ? <EOS> Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to `` move on , '' balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev , I expect the jury will vote 10-2 -LRB- or 9-3 -RRB- for death . <EOS> But they must be unanimous for death ; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence . <EOS> Worse , the historical record and headlines in the next day 's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim : `` Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber '' -- even if overwhelmingly the people 's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment . <EOS> Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many . <EOS> Why ? <EOS> Because in the end , we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people . <EOS> And yet , if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime , if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals , surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline : Mike Pence , a Koch Favorite , Mulls 2016 Run for President . <EOS> The story ticked off items on Pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . <EOS> Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers , and supported Gov. Pence 's tax-slashing budget . <EOS> Now , Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . <EOS> Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana 's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? <EOS> Because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence 's way of shoring up his street cred . <EOS> It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush , Pence 's fellow White House hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law . <EOS> One lesson here : Just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . <EOS> Backlash aside , the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . <EOS> And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped . <EOS> Pence : ` Was I expecting this kind of backlash ? <EOS> Heavens no . ' <EOS> For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters . <EOS> I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . <EOS> Instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan 's `` cultural war '' speech , during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention : `` We stand with -LRB- George H.W. Bush -RRB- against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women '' and later followed with `` There is a religious war going on in this country . <EOS> It is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself . <EOS> For this war is for the soul of America . '' <EOS> Progressives may enjoy watching Pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table . <EOS> And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination , someone has to . <EOS> In light of that , listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same-sex marriage : `` It 's like asking someone who 's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli . '' <EOS> Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal : `` I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . '' <EOS> Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions . <EOS> And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . <EOS> Remember : Pence did n't act alone . <EOS> He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . <EOS> In fact , according to the American Civil Liberties Union , `` the Indiana RFRA -LSB- Religious Freedom Restoration Act -RSB- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . <EOS> Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment . '' <EOS> Who supports , denounces Indiana law ? <EOS> Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . <EOS> Perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases . <EOS> Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . <EOS> Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary . <EOS> `` We 're winning , '' he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book . <EOS> I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . <EOS> That 's assuming you are part of the `` we '' who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts . <EOS> But as the situation in Indiana has shown , `` winning '' should not be mistaken for having `` won . '' <EOS> For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called `` religious freedom '' bills snaking through red-state legislatures . <EOS> Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate . <EOS> Pence , and to a lesser extent , Jeb Bush , may be toxic now but America has a short attention span . <EOS> More importantly , they are not alone . <EOS> Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . <EOS> If that holds true in 2016 , `` winning '' is going to feel very strange .
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Supreme Court justices appeared divided Tuesday during historic arguments over the constitutionality of gay marriage , with Justice Anthony Kennedy returning to a familiar role as the court 's pivotal vote . <EOS> Chief Justice John Roberts -- who shocked conservatives with his swing vote to uphold Obamacare -- this time seemed to lean more closely to conservative justices . <EOS> The arguments unfurled inside a packed courtroom on Tuesday while supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage rallied outside -- with one protester even interrupting the arguments from within . <EOS> RELATED : How a Cincinnati judge could shape the gay marriage case Many questions on Tuesday centered around the definition of marriage and whether the decision to authorize or ban gay marriage should be left to voters in individual states or decided by the judicial system . <EOS> All eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy , considered a key vote for challengers to the state bans , who has penned three decisions in favor of gay rights over the years . <EOS> At the start of arguments he joined other conservatives concerned with the fact that marriage has been defined between a man and a woman for a long time . <EOS> `` This definition has been with us for millennia , '' he said . <EOS> `` And it 's very difficult for the court to say : ` Oh , well , we know better . ' '' <EOS> But later Kennedy pressed John Bursch , a lawyer defending the bans : `` Same sex couples say : ` Of course , we understand the nobility and the sacredness of the marriage . <EOS> We know we ca n't procreate , but we want the other attributes of it in order to show that we , too , have a dignity that can be fulfilled . ' '' <EOS> Kennedy also said that Bursch 's assertion `` that only opposite-sex couples can have a bonding with the child '' was `` just a wrong premise . '' <EOS> When Bursch said the rate of out-of-wedlock birth has gone up in the country , Kennedy noted that if Bursch were to prevail , it might be difficult for same-sex couples to `` adopt some of these children . '' <EOS> `` I think , '' Kennedy said , `` the argument cuts quite against you . '' <EOS> He also brought up the fact that marriage `` bestows dignity . '' <EOS> `` These parties say they want to have that same ennoblement , '' he said . <EOS> Chief Justice John Roberts was also concerned with the traditional definition of marriage . <EOS> He said this to Mary L. Bonauto , an attorney representing the challengers : `` You 're not seeking to join the institution , you 're seeking to change what the institution is . '' <EOS> He expressed concern about closing off the debate currently going on in the states . <EOS> `` I mean , closing of debate can close minds , and it will have a consequence on how this new institution is accepted . '' <EOS> `` People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it , than if it 's imposed on them by the courts , '' he said . <EOS> Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito were sharply critical in their questioning of Bonauto . <EOS> Scalia said that the issue is not whether there should be same-sex marriage , `` but who should decide the point . '' <EOS> Alito brought up how long marriage has been considered between a man and a woman and cast doubt that such a definition was meant to demean same-sex couples . <EOS> Justice Sonia Sotomayor and other liberals seemed supportive of the challengers . <EOS> When Bursch said that the issue should not be decided by the courts , Sotomayor pushed back . <EOS> `` I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there 's some gay people who will choose not to . <EOS> ... Just as there are some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry . <EOS> So we 're not taking anybody 's liberty away . '' <EOS> Steve Vladeck , a constitutional law professor at American University and CNN analyst , said Tuesday 's session revealed few surprises to close observers of the court who expected Kennedy and Roberts would be the swing votes on this case . <EOS> RELATED : John Roberts ' big moment : Will he anger conservatives again ? <EOS> `` We heard both of them in the arguments today showing support for both sides of the argument , showing skepticism for both sides of the argument , '' Vladeck said . <EOS> `` I think the headline here is it 's about what we expected . <EOS> It 's going to be close , it 's going to be divisive and it 's going to come down to Kennedy and Roberts . '' <EOS> Vladeck also cautioned against reading too much into the justices ' questioning and comments during the oral arguments , which account for just a few hours in the multi-month process of deciding such an consequential case . <EOS> The emotion of the case also flooded into the courtroom , as one protester seated inside began shouted and screaming in the middle of the arguments . <EOS> `` If you support gay marriage you will burn in hell , '' the protester shouted before police quickly detained the man and dragged him out of the courtroom while he continued to scream . <EOS> RELATED : Meet the lawyers who will argue the gay marriage case `` Rather refreshing actually , '' conservative Justice Antonin Scalia quipped as the man was dragged out to laughter in the courtroom . <EOS> Lawyers with the pro-gay marriage organization Lambda Legal , which represented two of the cases wrapped into the Supreme Court case `` an awe-inspiring and singular moment in the march towards justice . '' <EOS> `` It was incredibly moving to gather in the Supreme Court chamber with their parents and all 30 plaintiffs in these historic cases . <EOS> Mary and Doug were fantastic , making a compelling and to my mind irrefutable case on their behalf , '' Lambda Legal 's Alphonse Gerhardstein said of the lawyers who argued in favor of same-sex marriage before the court on Tuesday . <EOS> U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli , who represented the Obama administration 's views , also presented arguments in favor of same-sex marriage , focusing on equal protection under the 14th amendment and likening bans on same-sex marriage to handing second-class status to gay Americans . <EOS> `` I do n't know why we would repeat history , '' he said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Doing weird stuff to your body in the name of beauty is n't anything new . <EOS> Humans have been changing the shape of our skulls , inking ourselves up and sticking things through various protuberances since before we figured out how to write . <EOS> But now we have Twitter and Facebook and hashtags , so these things seem to sweep around the world faster than a quick trip to the piercing joint . <EOS> And somehow , many trends these days seem to somehow involve a member of the Kardashian clan . <EOS> The latest : Lip plumping . <EOS> By sucking on a jar . <EOS> To look like Kylie Jenner . <EOS> Seriously . <EOS> It even has a hashtag : #KylieJennerChallenge Do n't worry , we said , `` What the ... ? '' <EOS> too . <EOS> But , we are , after all , in the business of providing you , dear reader , with information about the news , events and trends that surround you . <EOS> So please read on to learn more about this and other `` beauty '' trends inspired by the Kardashians : Used to be , YouTube would teach the kiddos how to put on eyeliner or style their hair like a favorite star . <EOS> That 's so old-school . <EOS> Now , the nets say you should stick your lips in a shot glass , suck all the air out and then pull it off to reveal your all-new plump kisser , just like Kylie Jenner . <EOS> Except , well , see for yourself . <EOS> The hashtag #KylieJennerChallenge has been trending on Twitter in recent days , with posters showing off the often disturbing results of their efforts . <EOS> `` Made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and I 'll say iv never felt so dumb , '' Twitter user emmaburkie posted Monday . <EOS> Plenty of folks shared the sentiment . <EOS> Many were people who 'd tried it . <EOS> Others were just shaking their heads . <EOS> Surgeon Dr. Dendy Engelman told Seventeen that the trend is dangerous . <EOS> `` Not only can significant pain , swelling , and bruising result from these suction techniques , but there is potential risk for scarring and permanent disfigurement with repeated attempts , '' Engelman said . <EOS> Jenner has tweeted her disapproval of the lip-plumping trend she inspired . <EOS> It 's a trend that predates the Kardashians , but they certainly gave us a lot of it : the sideboob , the flash of breast from the side of a dress , shirt or just about anything else that can be draped on a woman 's body . <EOS> According to Google , the arbiter of all things , search interest in sideboob has fallen off since its 2012 peak , when Huffington Post dutifully reported `` another day , another sideboob '' shot from Kim Kardashian . <EOS> How about something newer ? <EOS> Surely you 've heard of the `` belfie '' ? <EOS> A term reportedly coined by Kim Kardashian herself , this charming practice -- a butt selfie -- involves posting self-photography of one 's posterior , thusly : The trend took off last year , with a deluge of broadcast butts and not a little derision , but may have reached its peak with the apparently real belfie stick -- a device for taking `` perfect belfies simply and quickly . '' <EOS> Butt never fear , Kylie Jenner is here to keep the trend going , with a belfie taken just this month liked by 1.4 million people : Here 's a fact for you : In 2014 , the number of women undergoing `` buttock augmentation '' rose by a mountainous 86 % , according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Reports . <EOS> Why ? <EOS> Kim Kardashian , of course , say the doctors . <EOS> `` While a rounder , more curvaceous derriere has been in vogue for a number of years , celebrities like -LRB- Nicki -RRB- Minaj and Kim Kardashian have brought the attention to the rear to an all-time high influencing more women to undergo buttock augmentation to achieve the hourglass look , '' Dr. Constantino Mendieta said in an ASAPS statement . <EOS> And he should know . <EOS> He bills himself a `` butt augmentation specialist . '' <EOS> Back in the day , folks who wanted to look like Rachel from `` Friends '' got her haircut . <EOS> Now , they get surgery . <EOS> Well , some of them . <EOS> Meet Jordan James Parke , who made news this year with an interview with Britain 's The Sun newspaper in which he reportedly said he spent $ 150,000 to look like , you guessed it , Kim Kardashian . <EOS> He later told US Magazine he does n't want to look exactly like Kim . <EOS> But he 'd die for her butt . <EOS> `` I 'd like to get a bum as big as hers , but I wo n't get implants , '' the magazine quoted him as saying . <EOS> `` I 've been looking at body contour -- I want to get lipo on my stomach and back and then they put the fat back into your bum .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- The other day , I searched through hundreds of photos hoping to find a starting point to write this article . <EOS> Looking through old photos is usually an enjoyable experience -- coming across a wedding or remembrances of happy times with family and friends . <EOS> On this occasion , however , I found myself flipping through images from a devastating time we dearly wish had never happened but can not afford to forget . <EOS> White sand beaches stained with black sludge , oil-choked waterways and wildlife , shuttered businesses , and front-lawn signs pleading for justice and help . <EOS> Five years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster that killed 11 people , devastated livelihoods and wreaked havoc on the already fragile natural resources of the Gulf of Mexico region , it 's time to ask ourselves : What have we learned ? <EOS> And what are we willing to do make sure it does n't happen again ? <EOS> I spent much of 2010 in the Gulf , traveling through the communities , spending time with the people and witnessing the impact of this environmental catastrophe . <EOS> Five years later , I returned to see what has changed and what has remained the same . <EOS> First , it 's important to understand that the principle `` out of sight , out of mind '' does n't apply in the communities of Gulf Coast states . <EOS> The BP oil spill 's legacy continues to haunt this region like a recurring cancer . <EOS> On this most recent trip , I saw the ghostly remains of entire islands virtually swallowed up by the oil , and I learned about oystermen and fishermen whose livelihoods are still crippled by what happened five years ago . <EOS> Imagining Daddy : A rig worker 's daughter and her dreams Of course , that 's not to say progress has n't been made . <EOS> Community groups and dedicated organizations have worked ceaselessly to restore and repair not only the physical environment , but also the way of life . <EOS> This work is critical , and it deserves our attention and additional resources to continue to progress . <EOS> But make no mistake : Though a kind of normalcy has returned to the Gulf region and important progress has been made , the oil is still there . <EOS> What we do and do n't know about the oil spill A recent study from Florida State University estimates that up to 10 million gallons of that oil is still on the seafloor of the Gulf . <EOS> -LRB- BP disputes the study -RRB- . <EOS> Everything is not `` back to normal . '' <EOS> So far , BP has spent more than $ 14 billion on cleanup , and despite its assurances that everything is recovering , we witnessed a crew on a beach in Barataria Bay -LRB- off Louisiana -RRB- digging up oily sand . <EOS> Not what I would call recovered . <EOS> And while this kind of reflection is rarely pleasant , it is critical in order to avoid another tragedy on the scale of the BP spill , or potentially much worse . <EOS> It 's important to note that for areas like the Gulf , which are already affected by drilling , many of the common-sense safety reforms called for by the National Commission on the oil spill in January 2011 have yet to be implemented . <EOS> And yet , early this year , the Obama administration proposed a five-year offshore oil and gas drilling plan that , in addition to new areas in the Gulf , would open the southeast Atlantic Coast from Virginia to Georgia , as well as the majority of the wild Arctic to offshore oil and gas drilling . <EOS> In the case of the Arctic , one of the last pristine ocean habitats , oil companies have to admit that they are n't prepared to safeguard against the disasters that may take place if the plan is allowed to move forward . <EOS> Imagine what would happen if an oil spill occurred in a region where what little technology we have , like oil booms and controlled burns , is useless in the land of floating icebergs and catastrophic storms . <EOS> In the case of the Atlantic Seaboard , the increase in severe storms and rise in sea level , as well as what is at stake from an ecological standpoint , do n't paint a more optimistic picture . <EOS> We have a simple choice : Do we continue to make the same mistakes with a `` business as usual '' approach , or do we change the way we manage and use the resources the Earth provides us ? <EOS> I 'm not saying the path forward is easy . <EOS> It 's not , but this is a challenge we need to embrace . <EOS> Some solutions are relatively straightforward -- holding industry and our government responsible for human and environmental safety is certainly at the top of this list . <EOS> Taking the time and effort to understand our natural resources before we exploit them is another . <EOS> Despite its importance to navigation , fishing , oil and gas development , and maritime safety , our understanding of how the Gulf system works remains extremely limited . <EOS> Independent research free of corporate and government influence in the Gulf of Mexico is critical . <EOS> Projects like habitat mapping can result in countless ecological and economic benefits , such as improved assessments of fishery health , a baseline for tracking success of billions of dollars in restoration efforts , an essential foundation for modeling and monitoring the Gulf ecosystem , and a planning tool for better managing one of the hardest-working bodies of water in the world . <EOS> And , perhaps our biggest and most important challenge : We must continue to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels by developing sustainable energy solutions , including solar and wind power , and the sustainable jobs and opportunities that follow the kind of pioneering innovation that makes America such a great country . <EOS> Not long after the spill began , I was speaking to a group of elementary school students with my environmental education nonprofit EarthEcho International . <EOS> The students were all horrified and upset by what was happening in the Gulf . <EOS> At the end of a question-and-answer session , I asked them , `` Who is going to clean up this mess ? '' <EOS> All of them raised their hands and said in somewhat subdued unison , `` We will . '' <EOS> I 've told this story in the intervening years , and it 's always given me a sense of hope . <EOS> Thinking of those young children now also steels my resolve to make sure they do n't have to deliver on that promise . <EOS> The following local and national coalitions and organizations offer great starting points to become involved in the movement to restore the Gulf and its communities , and to make sure we take steps to prevent history from repeating itself : The Gulf Future Coalition , Ocean Conservancy , the Natural Resources Defense Council and the National Wildlife Federation .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- It 's time for liberals to look local . <EOS> With Washington gridlocked over almost everything and congressional Republicans standing firm against any further expansion of domestic policy , the odds of Congress passing another New Deal or Great Society are minimal . <EOS> It will take a lot of work by Democratic voters and activists to change the numbers on Capitol Hill so that liberal ideas stand a chance of passing . <EOS> Yet at the state and local level , the story has been much different . <EOS> Liberal Democrats have found more political space to move forward with their initiatives . <EOS> In New York City , Mayor Bill de Blasio has launched an ambitious pre-K education program to broaden access for all of the city 's residents . <EOS> In New Orleans , the mayor has put together a generous housing program to guarantee that there are no veterans without shelter . <EOS> The drive for same-sex marriage equality took hold in the states before reaching the federal level . <EOS> States such as Vermont , Oregon , and Washington as well as New Jersey have taken the lead in adopting eco-friendly policies . <EOS> While Congress has resisted President Barack Obama 's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 from $ 7.25 , 21 states and the District of Columbia went ahead and enacted minimum wage increases of their own . <EOS> This is just the tip of the iceberg . <EOS> At the annual conference for New America in Washington last week , the focus was on innovation . <EOS> The most exciting ideas are taking hold at the local level . <EOS> As the Atlantic 's James Fallows explained to the audience , when one moves beneath the gridlock of Washington and down to the towns and communities of America , it is quickly possible to see the `` functionality of politics '' -- where partisanship does not trump the need to solve problems . <EOS> This has given liberals an opening . <EOS> In Detroit , a company called Detroit Dirt is taking food scraps from local eating establishments and transforming them into compost for gardens to nurture communities and lower the environmental footprint of the city , Pashon Murray said at the New America conference . <EOS> Jonathan Mintz , the founding president and CEO of Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund , explained how his organization assists local governments to develop global partnerships that help lower - and middle-income Americans gain greater access to banking services . <EOS> But many liberal Democrats are uneasy about embracing this trend . <EOS> Since the New Deal in the 1930s , which followed the total collapse of the patchwork of local and state social welfare programs overwhelmed by the weight of the Great Depression , doing things at the national level has been seen as the only way to go . <EOS> Only by making programs national could policymakers ensure that state and local government officials -LRB- particularly Southern Democrats who had little taste for giving benefits to African-Americans -RRB- could not distribute benefits only to certain portions of the population . <EOS> Only the federal government had the taxing power necessary to sustain robust domestic initiatives . <EOS> In this view , it was believed that only Washington policymakers could bring together the best and brightest minds to make sure that programs were designed and administered well . <EOS> Only through centralized programs , could policymakers ensure that residents of one state did n't receive more meager benefits than in other places . <EOS> Some programs , like climate change , can only work well if every state has to follow the rules . <EOS> For the time being , liberals need to abandon that bias . <EOS> Even if all the fears are warranted , right now there are enough benefits to justify more local programs . <EOS> The most important obviously is simply practical . <EOS> This is the only opportunity that liberals have right now of seriously moving forward with new ideas . <EOS> Local and state politics are also proving to be arenas for great experimentation . <EOS> This is one of the lessons of the 1910s and 1920s , when liberal activists in states such as New York and Wisconsin experimented with programs ranging from unemployment insurance to the regulation of work conditions . <EOS> As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote , a `` state , may if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country . '' <EOS> Local policymakers and experts developed these programs for many years before they were ever brought to the national stage . <EOS> The result is that the policies were stronger and better tested , and some of the bad ideas had been discarded after it became clear they did n't work . <EOS> When Franklin Roosevelt came to office in the 1930s , he looked to these programs for inspiration about what to do at the national level . <EOS> The same was true in the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Congress put together civil rights , anti-poverty and urban development programs that had been implemented at the state level . <EOS> It was easier for federal officials to build support for their proposals when they could point to successful experiments . <EOS> Voters could see how they could work and how some of the worst predictions of opponents had not come true . <EOS> Conservatives have done the same in recent decades . <EOS> When Republicans pushed for welfare reform in 1996 , they drew many ideas from local changes that had been put into place in states such as Wisconsin , which had received waivers from national requirements . <EOS> The local arena is usually not ideal for creating big domestic policies since it depends on so many actors to sustain , since the politics of each region vary so greatly and since the financial muscle of smaller levels of government is much weaker . <EOS> Outside Washington 's more conservative environment , political conditions in many parts of the United States are producing important opportunities for liberalism to flourish . <EOS> This vibrant period of local policymaking will help to prepare the groundwork for the next moment -- like the early 1930s or mid-1960s or during the financial crisis of 2008-2010 -- when the doors for legislating will open in Washington .
Sanaa , Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- As soon as the buses parked , the people scrambled onto the airport tarmac . <EOS> They carried duffel bags , plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases . <EOS> They 'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound . <EOS> Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane . <EOS> The passengers were mostly Indian nationals , plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa . <EOS> They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes . <EOS> The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers ' faces . <EOS> Nobody wanted to be left behind . <EOS> They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew , all wearing pressed uniforms , the flight attendants fully made up . <EOS> After takeoff , the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight . <EOS> But some passengers were already fast asleep , exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen , site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast . <EOS> This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis , a Shiite group that has taken over the capital . <EOS> Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations . <EOS> Over the last few days , India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen , said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh , the Indian deputy foreign minister who 's overseeing the evacuation . <EOS> The flights are going to Djibouti , the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers -LRB- 267 miles -RRB- away . <EOS> Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden . <EOS> People are leaving behind much more than luggage . <EOS> Damodar Thakur , a professor at Sanaa University , lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there . <EOS> He loved living in Yemen . <EOS> `` I never felt like a foreigner , '' he said . <EOS> Like the others , he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches . <EOS> `` At night , my goodness ! '' <EOS> he said . <EOS> `` Gunshots being fired every minute . <EOS> Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights . <EOS> Some women crying , children terrified . <EOS> Really bad . '' <EOS> The Houthi rebels control Sanaa , including the airport . <EOS> But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way , so getting people out requires coordination . <EOS> The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing . <EOS> As the plane approached the city , the crew could see the scars of the fighting . <EOS> There were no cars on the roads . <EOS> Dozens of buildings were destroyed . <EOS> At the airport , the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs , but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits . <EOS> The loading of passengers was swift . <EOS> They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event . <EOS> They did n't pay for the flight , though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis . <EOS> Children sat on their parents ' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane . <EOS> Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff . <EOS> Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war , especially nurses who had tended the wounded . <EOS> From Djibouti , the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations . <EOS> `` Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind , '' Thakur said .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Ursula Ward kept repeating her son 's name -- Odin . <EOS> She steadied herself against the podium in the Fall River , Massachusetts , courtroom and occasionally paused . <EOS> She was tired after more than two years of pain , punctuated Wednesday when her son 's killer , Aaron Hernandez , was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison . <EOS> Odin Lloyd was her first born , her only son . <EOS> `` Odin was the backbone of the family . <EOS> Odin was the man of the house . <EOS> Odin was his sisters ' keeper , '' Ward told Judge Susan Garsh , before Garsh sentenced the former pro-football player . <EOS> Lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in June 2013 . <EOS> He played football for the Boston Bandits , the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winner of four championships in the New England Football League , according to the team 's website . <EOS> His mother , sister , uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family , a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor . <EOS> They said he rode his bike several miles to get to work . <EOS> He went to all of his niece 's recitals . <EOS> `` Odin was my first best gift I -LRB- will -RRB- ever receive , '' his mother said . <EOS> `` I thank God -LRB- for -RRB- every second and every day of my son 's life that I spent with him . <EOS> `` The day I laid my son Odin to rest , '' she continued , pausing to maintain her composure , `` I think my heart stopped beating for a moment . <EOS> I felt like I wanted to go into that hole with my son , Odin .

'' <EOS> She laughed , recalling his insistence on wearing the same Adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away . <EOS> He was `` prideful , '' she said . <EOS> He would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry , he 'd pull in with the car shining and clean , inside and out . <EOS> He taught her daughter how to ride a bike . <EOS> His murder , she said , `` feels like a bad dream . '' <EOS> Ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son . <EOS> `` I miss my baby boy Odin so much , '' she said . <EOS> `` But I know I 'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on . '' <EOS> She has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness . <EOS> `` I forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son 's murder , '' she said . <EOS> `` I pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors , '' -LRB- a -RRB- n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia . '' <EOS> The Columbia team concluded that `` The failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact-checking . '' <EOS> Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication . <EOS> The magazine 's managing editor , Will Dana , wrote , `` We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students . '' <EOS> Brian Stelter : Fraternity to ` pursue all available legal action ' The next question is : Can UVA , Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation ? <EOS> The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v.

'' <EOS> The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . <EOS> A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . <EOS> The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . <EOS> At first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? <EOS> The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . <EOS> But that 's only half the battle . <EOS> There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . <EOS> The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . <EOS> First , let 's eliminate UVA . <EOS> The university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . <EOS> The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : The government can not sue for defamation . <EOS> There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence . <EOS> Now the fraternities , starting with Phi Kappa Psi . <EOS> A fraternity is not an individual , but a group . <EOS> A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were `` of or concerning '' the plaintiff . <EOS> It sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . <EOS> When the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is `` concerning '' the individual -- and groups generally can not sue . <EOS> For example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . <EOS> Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . <EOS> Like all rules , however , there are exceptions . <EOS> If the defamatory language is about `` a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue . '' <EOS> If I said , `` The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals '' -LRB- they were n't -RRB- , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I did n't . <EOS> Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the `` small group '' exception fits it perfectly : Even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . <EOS> On the other hand , Rolling Stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid -LRB- after all , the membership changes somewhat every year -RRB- , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . <EOS> As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . <EOS> Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . <EOS> That 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . <EOS> So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . <EOS> And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on Facebook live in their moms ' basements and are `` between jobs , '' these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . <EOS> The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case . <EOS> The university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .
Shanghai , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- With a well-paid job in finance and his own apartment , Li Lifei is living the Chinese dream . <EOS> But there 's one missing ingredient -- his own car . <EOS> The 26-year old has his eye on a Volkswagen Tiguan but Shanghai , like many large Chinese cities , rations license plates as it looks for a solution to its gridlocked roads and polluted skies . <EOS> To register for a license plate auction , prospective car buyers like Li must put down a deposit in exchange for disc containing software they can use to bid online . <EOS> The auctions take place once a month on a Saturday morning . <EOS> `` I 've been trying for six months with no success , '' Li told CNN . <EOS> To boost his chances , Li upgraded the speed of his Internet connection from 10 to 50 mbps but to no avail . <EOS> Each month there are around 10,000 license plates available . <EOS> At the most recent auction on Saturday , Li said the final price was 80,600 yuan -LRB- $ 13,000 -RRB- -- around three times the price of a cheap Chinese car and a third of what Li plans to spend on his SUV . <EOS> It 's possible to get a temporary license , but that has to be renewed every month , and Li says he does n't want to use a huangniu , or middleman , some of whom employ hundreds of bidders to obtain the coveted registration . <EOS> `` I know people who 've been trying for more than a year , '' he said . <EOS> Another option would be to buy a hybrid vehicle that automatically qualifies for a license plate -- a selling point not lost on the car manufacturers showing their latest models and concepts at the Shanghai Auto Show this week . <EOS> Toyota , Volkswagen and Volvo all launched gasoline-electric hybrids for the Chinese market at the show , while Chinese manufacturer BYD has been an early pioneer of electric and hybrid cars . <EOS> `` The infrastructure -LRB- charging stations -RRB- for electric vehicles is not quite there yet but that 's the advantage of a hybrid -- you can have both , '' said Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson . <EOS> But Chinese drivers have n't wholeheartedly embraced the concept . <EOS> Even though China overtook the United States as the world 's largest car market in 2009 , sales of electric and hybrid vehicles , while increasing quickly , still lag behind the U.S. , where more than 100,000 were sold last year . <EOS> And it 's thought many are sold to local authorities and state industries , which are responding to central government directives . <EOS> Few Chinese have American-style garages where the vehicles can be charged overnight . <EOS> Li said he thought it would be inconvenient . <EOS> `` I do n't want a hybrid car . <EOS> I thought maybe a Tesla but it 's too expensive , '' he said , referring to the hyper luxury electric sports car developed by Elon Musk that has seen weak sales in China . <EOS> For others , the hassles of buying and owning a car have become too much and some affluent city dwellers are spurning cars . <EOS> Shanghai resident Lei Gu , 35 , learned to drive as a student and Microsoft employee in Seattle and loved driving her compact Geo on the open U.S. roads . <EOS> But when she returned to China nine years ago , she chose not to purchase a car . <EOS> `` I used to love driving but I do n't think I could drive here even if I wanted to . <EOS> `` Even though we have traffic rules , people do n't follow them . <EOS> I can barely cross the street . '' <EOS> She 's also put off by the congested traffic and the high cost of parking . <EOS> If Shanghai 's extensive subway system does n't take her where she wants to go , she uses a popular Uber-like taxi app -- or rents a car . <EOS> She 's not alone . <EOS> A recent report by consultants Bain & Company suggested that even though China 's love affair with the car began late , it may already be souring . <EOS> Of 2,137 people it surveyed , some 40 % said cars were losing their appeal as a status symbol . <EOS> Gu says luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedes are still an important way to `` show face '' among many of her friends . <EOS> `` If you 've been working for 10 years and do n't have a car , people might wonder if you have financial problems , '' she said . <EOS> But she prefers to spend her money on other things like traveling abroad . <EOS> `` I do care about face but there are other ways to show it .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- It 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria . <EOS> After all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive . <EOS> Such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information . <EOS> So what can and should we make of the organization ? <EOS> I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night . <EOS> And although it 's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS . <EOS> First , ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power . <EOS> There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots , but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein 's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . <EOS> An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel . <EOS> That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism . <EOS> But underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power . <EOS> Next , ISIS presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause . <EOS> The group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria , who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength . <EOS> The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time . <EOS> The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq . <EOS> But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos . <EOS> In the long run , ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate . <EOS> The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship . <EOS> They live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted . <EOS> In this respect , ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups , such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . <EOS> The result is ever-increasing repression . <EOS> Remember , no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere . <EOS> The group simply slaughters its way to control . <EOS> Of course , one of the big questions has been : Is ISIS a threat to the West ? <EOS> The group 's leaders declare that it is . <EOS> But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies , on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria . <EOS> They understand , of course , that to be Terror Group No. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's No. 1 power -- the United States . <EOS> With that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms , on their terrain . <EOS> Still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in America , their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there . <EOS> Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses , the group has changed the nature of terror . <EOS> The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine . <EOS> This means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet . <EOS> And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web . <EOS> The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions . <EOS> That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge , glory and gore . <EOS> Unfortunately , as long as those young Muslim men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Judge Jeffrey Sutton does n't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days . <EOS> Sutton , who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati , penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage . <EOS> His opinion , issued in November , goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans . <EOS> The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry . <EOS> And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage . <EOS> `` It 's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship , '' said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation , who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional . <EOS> Sutton `` more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made , and then one by one by one , he explains why it does n't work . '' <EOS> Critics call the opinion an outlier and do n't believe it will carry much weight , considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act . <EOS> `` Judge Sutton 's opinion stands alone , '' said Jon W. Davidson , legal director of Lambda Legal , a gay rights advocacy group . <EOS> Sutton , 54 , is the former state solicitor for Ohio , where he handled appeals for the state 's attorney general . <EOS> He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton `` one of the very best law clerks I ever had . '' <EOS> Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush , Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states ' rights . <EOS> Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday . <EOS> It is `` dangerous and demeaning , '' Sutton wrote , to the citizenry to assume that only judges `` can fairly understand '' the arguments for and against same-sex marriage . <EOS> `` Is n't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups ? '' <EOS> he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook , also a Bush appointee . <EOS> Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning . <EOS> `` The people do n't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards , '' Davidson said . <EOS> `` They do n't get to vote to violate the Constitution . '' <EOS> Sutton pointed to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment . <EOS> `` Nobody in this case , '' he wrote , `` argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage . '' <EOS> It 's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution . <EOS> `` From the founding of the Republic to 2003 , every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman , '' he wrote , noting that the `` Fourteenth Amendment permits , though does not require , States to define marriage that way . '' <EOS> He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy . <EOS> `` By creating a status -LRB- marriage -RRB- and by subsidizing it -LRB- e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions -RRB- , the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring . '' <EOS> He said that states should not be accused of `` irrationality , '' but only the awareness that same-sex couples do n't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex . <EOS> Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples . <EOS> He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by `` real people who teach our children , create our jobs , and defend our shores . '' <EOS> Gene Schaerr , a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah 's ban on same-sex marriage , calls Sutton 's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans . <EOS> `` He 's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another , '' Schaerr said . <EOS> But attached to Sutton 's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit . <EOS> Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey , a Bill Clinton appointee , dismissed the opinion as an `` engrossing TED talk '' and a `` largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism . '' <EOS> Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals `` suffering actual harm . '' <EOS> `` These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens , '' she wrote , but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status . <EOS> Her harshest language was for Sutton 's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process . <EOS> `` If we in the judiciary do not have the authority , and indeed the responsibility , to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate , our whole intricate , constitutional system of checks and balances , as well as the oaths to which we swore , prove to be nothing but shams . ''
-LRB- CNN -RRB- The United States is failing its partners . <EOS> If you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem . <EOS> The trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent Counterterrorism Partnership Funds -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism . <EOS> As a result , violent extremists are making troubling gains . <EOS> It 's not because we do n't recognize the problem -- nor that we do n't talk the talk . <EOS> The 2015 National Security Strategy speaks to the importance of American-led partnerships , while the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review noted that we `` will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity . '' <EOS> Despite this apparent recognition , the United States is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long-term investment in special operations units in key partner nations . <EOS> As a result of this neglect , since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the Middle East , but also in Indonesia , India and sub-Saharan Africa . <EOS> Just look at the case of Kenya . <EOS> On September 21 , 2013 , Al-Shabaab jihadists attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi , executing dozens of unarmed men , women , and children . <EOS> Less than two years later , at Garissa University , Al-Shabaab jihadists attacked university dormitories , butchering almost 150 people . <EOS> The perpetrators were separating the Christians from the Muslims and systemically executing the Christians before detonating their suicide vests . <EOS> During both incidents , the Kenyan forces ' response was horribly executed . <EOS> Sadly , Kenya is not the exception -- and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital U.S. assistance . <EOS> In 2015 , U.S. taxpayers are providing $ 5.65 billion in foreign military finance , the majority of which is going to Israel and Egypt . <EOS> Kenya , meanwhile , was slated to receive a mere $ 1.2 million . <EOS> Nigeria , which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of Boko Haram , has been afforded only $ 600,000 . <EOS> Simply put , the United States is spreading foreign military assistance too thin , while also failing to make necessary long-term commitments . <EOS> It takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities . <EOS> But although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy , U.S. security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners . <EOS> The reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare . <EOS> We are also failing to develop long-term programs of record , bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with Plan Colombia . <EOS> This program , as well as the recent U.S. mission to support our Filipino partners against Abu Sayyaf , demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by U.S. Special Forces when coupled with long-term funding and true interagency cooperation . <EOS> True , the Section 1206 Global Train and Equip program fulfills some needs , but money from the program only provides limited support -- it is an annual appropriation for `` new and emerging '' counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the U.S. armed forces are a participant . <EOS> Another program that builds special operations capacity , the Joint Combined Exchange and Training program , is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train U.S. forces first and foremost , not our partners . <EOS> With all this in mind , it is clearly time for Congress to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards . <EOS> By investing everywhere , we are investing nowhere , which is why we need to make choices about where the United States and its allies will see maximum benefit . <EOS> The United States has a choice -- reinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time . <EOS> But to get this right , Congress needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats . <EOS> This will mean asking the Departments of State and Defense to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete . <EOS> At the same time , Congress needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that State and Defense planners can do their job , too . <EOS> Attacks such as Mumbai and Westgate are easy to plan , do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the world -- we can expect to see a lot more of these . <EOS> But with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement , we can start to make progress . <EOS> It goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism , the causes of which are complex and diverse . <EOS> But having credible special operations forces is a great first step . <EOS> And for many of our partner nations , the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home .
Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- Four months after the end of the massive Occupy protests that clogged Hong Kong 's streets in a bid for greater voting rights , another confrontation is heating up in the former British colony . <EOS> The flashpoint ? <EOS> A controversial Beijing-backed election proposal tabled Wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto , describing it as `` ridiculous . '' <EOS> In a speech before the city 's legislature , Chief Secretary Carrie Lam said that if approved , the proposal would give Hong Kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017 . <EOS> The catch , of course , is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-China committee . <EOS> Dissenting pro-democracy legislators wearing black marched from the chamber as soon as Lam 's speech ended . <EOS> Some legislators raised yellow umbrellas , a symbol of the Occupy movement . <EOS> `` Their fake universal suffrage is an insult to everybody 's intelligence ; that 's why we refused to stay in the chamber . '' <EOS> Hong Kong Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau told CNN . <EOS> Lau said that she and other pro-democracy candidates would cast votes to ensure it does not become law . <EOS> Hong Kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years as the city fights over what kind of political system it should have as a Special Administrative Region of China . <EOS> According to the agreement signed by the United Kingdom that returned the city to Chinese control in 1997 , Hong Kong would receive 50 years of `` high autonomy '' under an arrangement called `` One Country , Two Systems . '' <EOS> Part of that deal included establishing an election system based on the principles of universal suffrage . <EOS> But nearly eighteen years after the handover , the city continues to fight over what universal suffrage really means . <EOS> Hong Kong 's leaders argue its latest proposal fulfills the long-awaited promise of universal suffrage by giving each resident the right to cast a vote . <EOS> All that 's left is for the legislature to approve the proposal , and then everyone can go home happy , they say . <EOS> Pro-democracy Hong Kongers beg to differ . <EOS> `` If it is a genuine election , people should be free to stand and people should be free to vote , '' said Lau . <EOS> `` Now all you have is a vote , and the candidates must be vetted by a committee consisting of business and political elites . <EOS> It 's horrendous . <EOS> `` To say the majority of Hong Kongers want to support this nonsensical package is a blatant lie . . <EOS> If nothing is changed , we will definitely vote it down . '' <EOS> To become law , the proposal must receive the support of two thirds of Hong Kong 's 70 legislators . <EOS> But Lau and 26 other pro-democracy legislators make up more than a third of the chamber , meaning they can veto the bill . <EOS> If they do , then the city 's electoral reform process will effectively return to square one . <EOS> Hong Kong 's leadership has warned pro-democracy legislators against the veto , saying the city might never again receive a chance for political reform . <EOS> `` We must strive for consensus , '' Lam told legislators . <EOS> `` We sincerely hope the pan-democrats abandon their passive attitude . '' <EOS> But consensus seems unlikely . <EOS> Hong Kong and Chinese leaders have repeatedly said there is no room for the proposal to change . <EOS> In response , Lau and other pro-democracy legislators will launch a citywide campaign this weekend to rally public opinion against the proposal . <EOS> And she did not rule out the possibility of a repeat of last year 's massive street protests . <EOS> `` Should people decide to resort to civil disobedience again , its up to them , '' she said . <EOS> `` Whatever we do , our struggle must be peaceful , orderly , nonviolent . <EOS> And we will do our best . '' <EOS> Wayne Chang and CNN 's Vivian Kam contributed reporting .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- Buckle up for another Mercedes battle in the Formula One world championship . <EOS> Lewis Hamilton took victory for the Silver Arrows at the Chinese Grand Prix -- only for his teammate Nico Rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly . <EOS> The reigning world champion captured his 35th grand prix win with a peerless pole-to-flag win under Shanghai 's sunny skies . <EOS> `` It was great to have a smooth weekend , '' the British racer said before spraying the champagne on the podium . <EOS> `` The team have done a fantastic job to up our pace and improve after our last race where we struggled a bit . '' <EOS> F1 championship standings Hamilton had lost the Malaysia Grand Prix in a strategic battle with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel but it was business as usual in Shanghai . <EOS> Rosberg came home second for Mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing Italian racers and renew his rivalry with Hamilton . <EOS> `` It was an important comeback for the team , '' said the 2014 championship runner-up . <EOS> Ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with Vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015 . <EOS> `` We just wanted to bring the podium back home , '' said Vettel , a four-time world champion with Red Bull Racing . <EOS> `` It 's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good . <EOS> I feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys . '' <EOS> Vettel is just 13 points behind Hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of Rosberg , after the first three races of the year . <EOS> Rosberg unhappy It was a disheartening weekend for Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season . <EOS> On Saturday , Hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and Rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio : `` Oh , come on guys ! '' <EOS> Then the German insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader Hamilton and Vettel , both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier . <EOS> `` Lewis is driving very slowly . <EOS> Tell him to speed up , '' Rosberg told the Mercedes pit wall . <EOS> Mercedes then instructed Hamilton on the team radio : `` OK Lewis we 'd like to pick the pace up a little bit . '' <EOS> Rosberg complained after the race that Hamilton 's lackadaisical Sunday driving was holding him up , pushing him back into Vettel 's thrall and taking life out of his tyres . <EOS> `` It 's interesting to hear from you Lewis about your pace up front , '' Rosberg said in the post-race media conference . <EOS> `` That was compromising my race . <EOS> Driving slowly , that was unnecessary , and meant Sebastian was closer to me . <EOS> `` It cost me a lot of time ... I 'm unhappy about that of course . '' <EOS> Hamilton responded : `` It 's not my job to look after Nico 's race . <EOS> It 's my job to bring the car home . <EOS> `` I did n't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down . <EOS> If Nico had wanted to get by he could have tried , but he did n't . '' <EOS> Bahrain Hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while Rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium . <EOS> If the German is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge , which went down to the final race in Abu Dhabi , he will need to turn things around soon . <EOS> Rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix in just seven day 's time . <EOS> Ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple Mercedes again , as they did on Sepang 's sizzling circuit . <EOS> The Italian team have the horsepower . <EOS> Vettel finished less than three seconds behind Hamilton in China with Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen fourth . <EOS> There was also a small feat further down the field as former Ferrari race winner Fernando Alonso finished his first race for the McLaren Honda partnership with 12th place in China . <EOS> The Spanish double world champion missed the Australian Grand Prix because of a head injury sustained in testing and then retired in Malaysia .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- In the beginning ... there was the Bible , and it was a very Good Book . <EOS> But this Catholic had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover . <EOS> So , in the middle of Holy Week , I decided to finally take the plunge . <EOS> Let me explain . <EOS> My name is Laura Bernardini and I 'm a director of coverage at CNN , which means I manage our newsgathering and newsroom in Washington . <EOS> I 'm also a lifelong Catholic . <EOS> At work this week , I was talking with some colleagues about Pope Francis ' upcoming trip to the United States . <EOS> During the course of that conversation , I admitted something that has privately bothered me for a long time . <EOS> I have never read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation . <EOS> This from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest-ranking Catholic in the bureau . <EOS> My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday . <EOS> And there are so many people that can so effortlessly quote long and beautiful passages . <EOS> I love to read , there is no excuse . <EOS> Still , it made me wonder : Why I had not read the Good Book cover to cover ? <EOS> I took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my Catholic high school , but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about . <EOS> Later , when I graduated , my grandparents gave me a beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington . <EOS> But in 24 years , I never so much as cracked the cover , other than to write the date I received the gift . <EOS> In that newsroom conversation this week , Daniel Burke , the religion editor at CNN.com , suggested I read the Bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for Belief . <EOS> I will admit to being pretty stunned and a little scared at the prospect . <EOS> I figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process . <EOS> I am no scholar , no expert on scripture , as should be obvious . <EOS> But the more we talked , the more the idea grew on me . <EOS> I have committed to training regimens for 5Ks and countless diets , so why not try this ? <EOS> I have been looking for a form of meditation in my hectic life . <EOS> This might just be it . <EOS> My friends seem excited about this project , sending me some of their favorite passages , which I 'm keeping a list of . <EOS> One Catholic friend offered to join me , suggesting I get a blank journal to help me take notes . <EOS> The colleague that I sit next to everyday has already sent me his Bar Mitzvah passage and wants to discuss it when I get there . <EOS> Another friend 's daughter is making her first Holy Communion in May , and has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the Bible in school . <EOS> So , in a way , I 'm going back to first grade in Catholic school . <EOS> Yay for me . <EOS> Overall , my friends and family are mainly curious how this journey will end . <EOS> I am , too . <EOS> Will I make it all the way to Revelation come next spring ? <EOS> I start on Easter Sunday . <EOS> I hope you 'll join me .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- In the end , it played out like a movie . <EOS> A tense , heartbreaking story , and then a surprise twist at the end . <EOS> As eight of Mary Jane Veloso 's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners , like her -- were put to death by firing squad early Wednesday in a wooded grove on the Indonesian island of Nusa Kambangan , the Filipina maid and mother of two was spared , at least for now . <EOS> Her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called `` execution island '' when a Philippine TV crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution . <EOS> Her ecstatic mother , Celia Veloso , told CNN : `` We are so happy , so happy . <EOS> I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good . <EOS> Thank you to everyone who helped us . '' <EOS> Supporters were `` overjoyed '' with the news . <EOS> `` This is all because of the efforts of the Filipino people and the international community who have been with Mary Jane , her family and the Filipino people all throughout , '' a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh-hour reprieve . <EOS> Veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from Malaysia to Indonesia when $ 500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage . <EOS> Supporters , including the Filipino advocacy group Migrante , and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking . <EOS> They say she was offered work in Malaysia , but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and was n't aware the bag she 'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs . <EOS> The Philippine Embassy in Indonesia 's capital , Jakarta , said Wednesday that it welcomed the reprieve and appreciated that the Indonesian government appeared to be reconsidering the case . <EOS> `` While Mary Jane was convicted for a drug-related offense in 2010 , the Philippines believes that due to her personal circumstances , she herself is a victim of heartless drug syndicates , '' embassy political secretary Jed Llona said . <EOS> `` The alleged recruiters of Mary Jane are currently being investigated in the Philippines , and the embassy hopes that through this ongoing case , those truly responsible for drug trafficking in the region are brought to justice . '' <EOS> Questions about her detention and trial , including the competency of her translator , have also been raised . <EOS> Veloso had been given the customary 72 hours ' notice of execution , and her family had traveled to Nusa Kambangan to say their final goodbyes . <EOS> However , developments in her home country appear to have changed -- or at least delayed -- her fate . <EOS> CNN Philippines reported that Veloso 's alleged recruiter , Maria Kristina Sergio , and her partner Julius Lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the Philippines Tuesday . <EOS> Sergio faces charges of illegal recruitment , human trafficking , and fraud , but maintains her innocence . <EOS> Sergio said that she had received anonymous death threats by phone , and further threatening messages from Veloso 's family on social media . <EOS> Veloso 's lawyer , Edre Olalia , confirmed that developments in the case had prompted the stay . <EOS> `` As far as Mary Jane is concerned , her life has been spared for the moment and the reason is that the legal proceedings in the Philippines must be respected first in view of the fact that the illegal recruiter is now in custody , '' he told CNN Philippines . <EOS> Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters Wednesday that the decision was the result of the Indonesian government 's desire to cooperate with the ongoing case in the Philippines . <EOS> `` There was a letter from the Philippine government saying that there is a legal process related to human trafficking there . <EOS> So we need to respect this legal process . '' <EOS> He stressed , however , that the execution was delayed , rather than canceled . <EOS> Veloso 's case has touched the public in her native Philippines , with the highest levels of government and celebrity calling for mercy . <EOS> President Benigno Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur last weekend and pressed for him to commute Veloso 's sentence . <EOS> Filipino boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao , who is primed to fight longtime foe Floyd Mayweather Saturday , made a televised appeal to President Widodo , also asking for mercy for Veloso . <EOS> `` I am begging and knocking on your kind heart that Your Excellency will grant executive clemency to her , '' he said . <EOS> Veloso 's sons , Mark Daniel and Mark Darren , ages 6 and 12 , issued a heartbreaking plea , aimed at Widodo 's son , asking him to intervene . <EOS> `` Please tell your father not to execute her , '' they asked . <EOS> Ordinary people are also fighting for their compatriot , including Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong , who protested at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong Tuesday . <EOS> Philippine Embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday . <EOS> Lawyers fighting to delay her execution previously said they 'd given up their bid after her second legal review was rejected on Monday .
